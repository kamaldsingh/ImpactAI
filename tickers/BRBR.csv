[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of ken goldman with jp morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
mike, good morning, and thank you for the question. so, the moment, darcy, that you mentioned the revenue shifting into the second half, the stock took a little bit of a leg lower. can you add a little bit of color into the timing change in terms of the promotion, what happened? do you think it's sort of just standard fare in terms of, hey, sometimes customers decide to move things into a different quarter? just help us, if you can, understand a little bit more of what happened there?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. hi, ken.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, this -- i believe that we highlighted this last quarter that we often see changes in the promotional calendar, and sure enough, we did this year. there is -- so the move is from q2 into q3 and four, heavier in q4. but we see this -- most competitors, i think, would see this a similar thing, and we as well, as standard fare.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so, it's nothing atypical, it's just something that you think you've seen in the past. is that a fair way of describing it?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
something similar?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then a quick follow-up on dymatize. i think you -- if i were to go back and look at my notes from before the ipo.
i think management was looking for a little bit of a better performance by now for dymatize. can you just give us a little more color as to whether it's been a little disappointing or whether that's a timing shift as well? any help there would be appreciated, too.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, i don't think it's necessarily disappointing. i believe that we still expect the business to rebound from -- last year, there was an inflection point where it was declining and we were lapping some of the declines in specialty and we started seeing an increase in both ecommerce and sgm. the one thing that we are lapping a large pipeline build in one of our -- in a club customer last year.
so, because those volumes are very large, it's a tough comp. so, we still expect the year to land in a positive direction and we're already -- we're seeing some good distribution wins in fdm. so again, our diversification strategy is absolutely going the way we expect. and mostly, this is just a timing thing, some volume going from q1 to q2.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
correct.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

your next question is from andrew lazar with barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
i guess, first off, i want to make sure i heard you right, i think you said that in january for premier, for the ready-to-drink shakes, our consumption was up 48% in tracked and then faster in nontracked. if i heard that right, i'm just trying to get a sense of if that was in line with what you had expected consumption would do? or it sounds like a bigger number than i would have expected, but i don't know if it was in line with how you thought about it. and then second would be, it may be too early, but if you can talk a little bit about the -- or from what you've seen so far around the incrementality of some of the new flavors/products that you're putting out there? thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so for the consumption in january, it is -- we're very pleased with the number. it's nice to see the progressive increase from -- we are at about 17% in q4. now -- and then in q1, we were at 28%, and then, to see january hitting at 45%. we're definitely pleased to see that movement.
i will say, based on expectations, i do think it's a little bit better than our expectations. however, we're doing a lot of things we've never done before. so, i think that we were -- as you know, we've never done national television. we've been pulling back from -- for the -- really, the last two years on promotion, as well as, mass marketing.
so, this is the first time in years that we've actually been able to press the accelerator. but yes, we're very pleased with the consumption results.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. and then, any incrementality? yeah.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
regarding -- yeah. regarding incrementality. we are still seeing incrementality with our flavor strategy. we are now up to -- cafe latte will be our eighth flavor in the line and the way we evaluate incrementality is looking at chocolate at -- the effect of chocolate and vanilla, our base flavors.
it's a little difficult, honestly, to evaluate that right now because we're lapping the two-flavor strategy. so, we are seeing a decline in chocolate and vanilla currently. but that is more a reaction to the fact that they were the only ones being sold a year ago.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
right.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, it is messy right now. i will just be honest. however, having cafe latte be the no. 3 flavor in the line where it's sold in several of our accounts is really encouraging.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thanks very much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, i had a question first, if i could. and then, just to better understand the phasing of ebitda then between the first half and second half. and as you probably know, post was able to give a little bit more color around the percentages, we already were more second-half loaded. should we be, obviously, even more second-half loaded? can you give any relative size of first half or second half? i guess, a question for paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so, i think the way we're thinking about it is, yes, we're seeing some shift in promotional timing, which would push a little bit more revenue than we had initially anticipated toward the second half. and so, i think the short answer to your question is, yeah, i would think that based on, i think, what's out there.
yes, i think there's a little bit more movement into the second half than the first half, but not dramatically so. so, i think a little bit more on the revenue side. but yes, we do expect to see some movement.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and so --
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
and ebitda should follow the revenue.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's ok. thank you, guys. ok. and then i just want to understand the -- like the shipment timing for the new products.
so cafe latte, i believe, did that ship last quarter? and then, oats is shipping this quarter, is that the way to think about it? i'm just trying to understand like the incremental shipment factor from those new products and the timing it's sort of the way that'll benefit the revenue growth.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
correct. yeah. cafe latte did start shipping in the first quarter, and then, we are seeing protein with oats in the second quarter.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, just for specifics and cafe latte started shipping in october, and then, protein with oats began shipping in ecommerce in the beginning of january and is shipping in line on q1. so, just earlier or late last week.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and would that line up with your expectations previously, and therefore, as we think about the revenue growth and the incremental nature of those incremental shipments, that's pretty well as expected?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
as expected, the one thing that i would say is, as we gain distribution and watching it on the shelf that will obviously raise or lower our expectations. i do not -- i don't think that we expect the cafe latte pushing to no. 3.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. gotcha. that's great. thanks for your time.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from john baumgartner with wells fargo.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i guess, first off, darcy, just coming back to that revenue shift you noted for favoring q4 because, i guess, calendar-wise, at that point, it's really getting away from peak consumption season for the category. are you getting the sense all the retailers are maybe looking to build interest and consumption, maybe, counter seasonally? and i guess, i'm crossed up because you're not the first company in the category to mention changes in shipment timing and it seems to run almost counter to normalized patterns this year.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, i think that retailers are experimenting with different timing to maximize their promotions. we've seen different retailers evaluate, again, different timing, different bundles, etc. so, absolutely, i believe that's happening. with regards to seasonality of the category.
the only seasonality we see is really -- we have about a 90 indexed in november, december, and then, that shoots up in jan, feb. but actually, back-to-school timing is actually a good time for the category. and i think, it mainly just follows foot traffic within the store.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, just to follow-up on the volume strength for the shakes, both in measured and nonmeasured channels. i mean, that's included some fairly hard comps the last couple of months and it's also prior to the uptake in the advertising and the impressions in the market, which you would think would have even more of a benefit going forward.
so, i guess my question is, is there increasing chance that you can run pretty tight on capacity again, even with the advanced notice that you've had coming into the year? i mean i hadn't contemplated it, given the preadvanced notice you've given your suppliers and all. but i mean, how do you think about capacity now versus what your expectations were back in october?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it's a great -- it's a great question. i would say that we have two flexibility levers that give me confidence that we have plenty of inventory and capacity. the first is safety stock or shake inventory. we deliberately increased our inventory as we went into q2 so we could absorb demand increases.
and then, the second is just the [inaudible] network and we do have the ability to surge higher if needed. so with those two levers that we feel confident that we can, again, surge inventory and manage that increase of demand. now, i mean if suddenly the business is tenfold higher. i think that's probably a good issue to have.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. so, anything short of a tenfold. ok. sounds good.
thank you very much.

your next question is from ken zaslow with bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
just two quick questions. one is, you kind of said to the higher end of your guidance, both on sales and ebitda. could you talk about what is actually driving that? and what is the increased confidence, particularly given that there's a shift to the fourth quarter?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's a combination of a very strong q1. and then, the early reads of both the new products, as well as, the advertising, very early, but we're feeling good about where we are. also, as we talked about earlier in the call, the consumption is -- we're pleased with where the consumption is in january.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
and the second one is, in terms of capacity, just to double-check, you're not seeing any other building or any other capacity, co-package capacity expansion across any of the premier type of products out there. is that a valid comment?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i would answer this twofold. the first is, there was a -- there has been a ton of expansion throughout the last few years. and so, there is a start-up curve. so, the existing network is now, i would say, over the hump of the start-up curve and now is performing very efficiently.
ok. that's the first piece. the second piece is -- i don't think i'm comfortable in this setting to talk about new lines, etc. but i think there is some growth in the network that is happening.
ken zaslow -- bank of montreal -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
your next question is from bill chappell with suntrust robinson.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
hi, this is actually grant on for bill. thanks for taking the question. had one on the consumer base, now that you guys have lapped the capacity constraints in the year-ago period, are you seeing kind of the consumers that left the category come back? are you seeing new consumers come into the category? just trying to get a little bit more detail on the breakout of the volume growth this quarter.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, we haven't completely lapped the two-flavor strategy yet. so, we are -- if you're looking at consumption and this is actually good for you guys to know. so, as you look at consumption, we reintroduced the new flavors, basically, last year between february and april. so, all of the new flavors would be back on the shelf for the most part in april.
so, we are still lapping that and -- but back to your question around new consumers, we do believe that we have regained all -- any of the locked consumers. we actually, during that period of time, lost less consumers than we ever would have thought. they actually went to chocolate and vanilla and it's more of a testament to the loyalty to the brand as opposed to necessarily a loyalty to a flavor. and i think even more is that we saw our household penetration go from 5% for the brand now to 5.8%.
that -- percentage-wise, it's pretty good jump, although, still a small number and highlighting how much room for growth there is.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then, just had a quick one on dymatize. is there any way you guys could quantify the timing of promotion impact on growth in the quarter, maybe a consumption number there would help, too.
thank you.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
so the -- you're talking about us lapping the promotion in the prior year. what was the impact of that to their --
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
correct. correct.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. it is most of the decline.
grant o'brien -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.

your next question is from bryan spillane with bank of america.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so, i guess i had -- just had two questions related to maybe the impact of the advertising that you've run here early in the year. i guess two things. one, given that it seems like it's having an effect, right, in terms of market share. any thoughts about how maybe you approach back-to-school differently in terms of maybe spending more advertising around the back-to-school timeframe?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i still -- even though i'm pleased with the results so far. i still would say it's early.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
but we are evaluating it. so, we are going to continue to watch it. again, a few weeks in, the results -- there's been a nice bump to the business, as well as, like i said, some of the digital indicators like google search, which is nice, but we're still watching. and also, the advertising goes for the next -- through q2.
so, we will evaluate the results, and then, assess our strategy going forward.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and then maybe second, somewhat related is just as you're seeing the increase in consumption here early in the year. how have you fared in terms of in-stock levels, and also, just being in stock with the most popular skus? so, just how you've -- has there been any sort of static around that as you've gone through january and early feb?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i think it's fairly normal on the existing flavors. we -- in fdm, we always have in-stock issues. honestly, it's -- those are the things that we go back to our retailers and explain why we need more phasings of the existing flavors. that is at an extreme when you don't have history, like on the new flavors, such as cafe latte.
so, we've seen a fair amount of out of stocks at where we have cafe latte. but i think over time, retailers see it and they adjust.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

your next question is from david palmer with evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi, good morning. i know it's early to talk about out-years. but if the new products this year have good repeat, and i know that's an assumption, but you've typically had a pretty good repeat for your products. how should we think about '21 in terms of that being -- is that going to be more of a year like this one, where we'll look back on 2020 and say, that's a typical year, '21 will be comparing against a fairly typical year and that you'll have similar amounts of innovation, marketing, and spending, even the timing of the new products.
or will -- are -- or is there something unusual about this year, just like the one you're lapping last year? and then, i have a follow-up.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i think 2020 is more typical. this isn't -- that you're going to say this is about as obvious as it comes. but 2020 is more typical than 2019. and i think from an innovation standpoint, i mean, we have a strategy right now of ramping up innovation.
so, i think that -- but there's only so much that the retailers can handle and an organization can handle. so, yes, in general, i would say 2020 is a typical year that you can use. now, having said that, if our marketing efforts surprise us in a positive way, i could see pushing -- putting more spend on advertising.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you, and i guess, related to that if you are going to be doing more on the marketing side and perhaps even pursuing new areas of product extensions in the innovation pace that costs money. i wonder on the leverage side of that, it costs money to have co-packers, and certainly, have co-packers waiting for you. how should we think about the leverage in the model as you get to greater scale? do you -- can -- is there even leverage within this co-packing model, such that you can have a bit of a flywheel back into marketing?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
so, i mean from an overall leverage perspective, i mean, i think, as we've talked about previously, i mean, we have a target leverage of 3 times and we think we can get into that range in the next fiscal year or so. but we feel like, within our current model, we can -- and you mentioned it's an asset-light model. we can continue to invest behind our marketing and our r&d within reason without having to go to get the debt or to increase our leverage to do that. we feel like we could do that within the confines of our business model as it is.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
i mean, i guess and just to clarify, what i'm really talking about is, we're a little under 20% ebitda margins currently. can you reinvest in marketing and have that ebitda margin continue to creep up into the 20s, say, and find leverage in the model, even while as you reinvest in marketing, assuming the new products work. thanks. i'll pass it on.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
oh, sorry, i misinterpreted. yes. so, i think that's a good point. i think we can -- i think there's a couple of ways for us to think about it.
i think as our business grows and we gain scale, we do think there can be additional gains on the ebitda margin side, but we also see this as a high-growth business that we want to continue to invest behind. and so, we will continue to do that so that we drive top-line growth. and so, as we looked at our long-term algorithm, we talked about an 18% to 20% ebitda margin. so, i think that would imply that we would continue to invest behind our brands to continue driving that top-line double-digit growth.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think our long-term algorithm assumes that we will reinvest in the businesses.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thank you.

your next question is from jason english with goldman sachs.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for sliding me in. congratulations on a good start to the year. a couple of quick questions for me. the program you shift, the promotional shift with the retailer you're talking about.
are they shifting out the program for the entire category or have they just swapped to your brand out for another competitive brand?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure if we have that information. we know that they have moved -- like i said, they're experimenting with different bundles, as well as, timing. so, i'm not sure if -- yeah, i don't know if i have that specific information.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. well, a higher order. can you discuss what you're seeing on the competitive landscape? well, obviously, it's a focus for simply can foods recently in the shake space. we've seen quest push in, we're seeing pure protein, we're seeing equate on a label side, a lot of activity.
and obviously, the investment behind some of the brands during the quarter still. there's a lot of activity out there. what are you seeing in terms of impact to your business? and if we think about the competitive landscape more holistically, this helps them on the shape space had been fragmenting, it looks like it was beginning to reconcentrate, but it's -- with the amount of activity, it looks like we could be on the customer, but notice there's been a bit of a refragmentation cycle. is that fair? i'm sorry.
i know there was a lot in there. i almost start rambling to that question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'll do my best to answer it, and then, let me know if i missed something. so, the category is -- i mean, as you guys know, it is attractive and competitive and have been competitive for years. obviously, i still maintain that the bar category is even more competitive than shakes. but we have seen an uptick in competitive activity, again, for the last couple of years.
i think what is encouraging is that for the last two years, we've, in essence, as a brand had to watch because we didn't have the ability to press the accelerator. and what is nice now is that we can now kind of play our hand and we can get back in there, launch national advertising, accelerate our innovation, push for promotions and displays, which we know drives the business. so, to answer your question about how it's affecting our business. we have not seen a tremendous impact from a competitive standpoint on our business.
i think it goes to the fact that we have a unique brand. we've built a strong following with high repeat and loyalty, and we still have a very low household pen. and so, we have room to grow.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from robert dickerson with jefferies.
robert dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much. so a couple of quick questions. i guess first question is going back to the spring reset and digging into what that is. you know, i'd say, the number of categories that are fairly large and a little bit more growthy over the past couple of years.
we, as outward observers, have heard and seen the retailers, at times, maybe resetting this shelf or taking a little bit longer to reset the shelf than maybe historically done because maybe they're looking to expand overall square footage. like you said, maybe, there's a bundling piece they're testing. so, i sit here now and i looked at your stock performance on the day, which is obviously pressured. but kind of want to give the opportunity too, to say, ok, well, there is a little bit more shift into the back.
sometimes that shift can be perceived as a negative. and sometimes, though, the negative is not correct because is there a possibility that the shift has something to do with just ongoing retailer support of a subcategory within food, some of which operates in the health and beauty aid section that's actually done very well. and now, the retailers actually say, ok, well, we want to support this more so, but we need to step back. we might need more time.
there's more competition and we need to figure out how to really reset the shelf. not just in club but kind of across channels.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, i do not view the shift as negative. i actually think for our business specifically, just because we have come off an odd year, where we had capacity constraints. i think every month the brand -- i think we gain confidence in the retailers' eyes because they see that we're one of the most productive skus on the shelf. so, i believe that we will have a more successful spring reset than we did fall reset.
so, i don't believe that the back half comment is at all negative.
robert dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i actually think that it could actually be positive because it takes time for a lot of our advertising to set in. and the other thing that is unique about this category is, many categories have one time of the year that the entire nation resets, that is not this category. it is a rolling reset. so, i mean, i think, i estimated that it's about 50% in the fall, 50% in the spring, but that does change.
robert dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. perfect. great. and then, i guess, just to touch on cash usage this year.
obviously, there are a number of moving parts since having gone public. but just asset-light model, good free cash flow generation. we haven't really touched on that much today in the call. how should we all be thinking about cash usage going forward, if in fact, you don't need to really put it into capacity?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, i mean, this is as you mentioned, we're an asset-light model. it's a strong cash-generating business and we expect that to continue. we did have negative operating cash in the first quarter.
that's not atypical for us because we tend to have heavy shipments in the month of december, which drives our receivable balances higher. and so, that tends to cause a little bit of a cash outflow. but we're still expecting strong cash flow for the year. obviously, with cash taxes and interest expense, which combined are in the neighborhood of about $80 million.
but we expect otherwise to generate strong free cash flow. our capex, we continue to guide to $4 million of capex. so, we still expect strong cash generation for the year.
robert dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah. i mean, i guess, i was kind of asking if we've heard from post, right there. they're levered a little bit lower than historic standards for that company. for you, you're, i think, around 3 times, but also, still kind of under the auspices of post.
so, i was trying to gain more color as to -- i think i've heard you say, yes, we already have an ongoing pipeline, thinking about kind of maximized leverage levels for you. and any appetite whatsoever for kind of near-term tuck-in or just overall acquisition activity would be great. that's it. thank you.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so our leverage currently is at 3.5 times. we do expect toward -- as we get into next fiscal year, that we can get down to our target of 3 times.
yes, acquisition opportunities, we're always looking. i don't know if you want to touch on acquisitions?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think that what's fundamentally different between bellring and post is that we have a massive organic growth opportunity with premier. and i think, we still believe that it is by far the biggest opportunity in the category. so, we are going to feed that and that is our focus.
now having said that, as we look down the road, we will always be watching what's out there. and i think, toward the beginning -- at the end of 2020 and the beginning of '21, we'll be in a really good cash position to act on something that we find interesting and that would be synergistic with our other businesses.
robert dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
super. thank you.

your final question comes from the line of pamela kaufman with morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning. so, i wanted to ask about your product innovation pipeline. i'm curious if cafe latte's early success influences the way that you're thinking about new innovation in terms of combining other functional benefits with the core product. and any update on the timing of your plant-based shake launch?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so from an innovation standpoint, we are constantly looking at different claims. we're looking at different types of protein. we're looking at even a different format. so -- and if you remember, it is a long development cycle.
so, the -- we -- it takes anywhere between 18 and 24 months to develop a shake. so, we already have several different paths that we are evaluating from an innovation standpoint. and i think that in this forum, i don't think i'm comfortable talking about specific innovation ideas. but just know that we have a whole group of people and they're looking at the trends and evaluating where we think the next place to mine is.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, and can you talk about the international opportunity for premier? you mentioned the growth that it's experiencing in canada. so, how far along are you in the launch in canada and where else do you see opportunity for growth internationally?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
we see premier, as well as, powerbar and dymatize having a very large opportunity internationally. our biggest market is canada for premier, but we are seeing some solid growth in the eu. we just launched in the u.k. for premier and getting distribution in the fdm area and we are also launching in mexico.
so, i think that across the board -- and we have a sizable international business for dymatize, about 40% of the business is in international through distributors. and then, obviously, we have powerbar, a very strong foothold in the eu. so overall, i think the -- i think the way i've talked about in the international opportunity is it takes time. it is absolutely a growth driver.
i think we're uniquely positioned because we have an office in germany. and i think that that will be a growth driver, but it does take time to build it.

matt mainer -- investor relations
thank you. good morning, and thank you for joining us today. with me are darcy davenport our president and ceo; and paul rode our cfo. darcy and paul will begin with prepared remarks, and afterward, we'll have a brief question-and-answer session.

darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt, and thank you all for joining us this morning. as most of you know, the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was our first quarter as a publicly traded company. i'm happy to report that we had an excellent quarter and a strong start to the year. i will begin today's discussion by giving an overview of our first-quarter performance and then provide an update on distribution, marketing, and innovation.
finally, i will give some insight into our 2020 guidance. paul will then discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail before we open it up for your questions. during our first quarter, the convenient nutrition category remained strong, continuing to be a tailwind for us. as reported by nielsen, the category was up 5.2% versus the same period a year ago, with the total liquid subcategory of 7.1%.
macro trends like mainstreaming of proteins, convenience, and snacking continue to fuel the growth. turning to our performance. we had a strong first quarter with net sales hitting an all-time high of $244 million, up 31% driven by premier protein shakes. adjusted ebitda grew by 43%, driven primarily by higher sales and gross margin.
although significantly better than a year ago, it is in general -- it is generally in line with our expectations. premier ready-to-drink shakes, which represents 80% of our portfolio, was up 50% in sales and consumption was up 28% in tracked channels driven equally by volume and distribution gains. the difference between shipment and consumption is mainly due to customer and building inventory in advance of new year promotions, as well as, pipeline fill related to new distribution. in addition to these drivers, our growth also benefited from the lapping of capacity constraints in the prior year.
lastly, we had two exciting launches during the quarter in our 30-gram shake line. pumpkin spice, our first limited edition, which we tested in ecommerce and cafe latte, which is our first shake launch with caffeine. pumpkin spice was a successful test and cafe latte has already become our third best-selling flavor in several accounts where it is sold. we continue to be pleased with the results of our flavor strategy.
dymatize, our second-largest brand continues its successful diversification into ecommerce and food, drug, mass. we had a strong ecommerce sales quarter and secured additional fdm distribution commitment. dymatize sales are down in the quarter. however, this is mainly due to lapping a significant pipeline fill in the prior year.
so, we remain encouraged by the brand's momentum. our international business had a strong quarter as well, up 16% in net sales driven by premier protein shakes mainly in canada. dymatize and powerbar also contributed, both growing single digits. in the eu, all three brands had new distribution gains with powerbar and premier protein making progress against our fbm expansion strategy.
i'm happy to report that from an operational standpoint, our shake [inaudible] network is performing well. we have inventory and capacity flexibility to aggressively drive demand and execute on our growth plans. as we have discussed, we have multiple strategies for continued growth and our near-term focus -- with our near-term focus on increasing household penetration, expanding distribution and driving innovation. we are making significant progress on all three fronts.
we launched our premier protein national marketing campaign in january, including for the first time, national television and increased promotional displays in most of our major accounts. we are pleased with the early brand indicators and the in-store and execution. in fact, we have already seen a two-point increase in market share since the launch of the advertising, as well as, a lease in google organic search, clearly indicating that we are breaking through with consumers. from a distribution standpoint, shake pdps increased 34 points or 7% in the quarter, with gains in cafe latte across multiple accounts, as well as, an expanded space on our base labors.
we also gained an additional sku this quarter in one of our club accounts. we expect to further increase our shelf presence during the spring lease-up. from an innovation standpoint, i am proud of the capabilities we have built as an organization. we have many new innovations in the pipeline and some currently hitting the market.
for example, we are introducing our first shake line extension, premier protein with oats. it targets consumers looking for a more wholesome and balanced offering with 20 grams of protein, seven grams of fiber, and the benefit of oat. the line has three flavors that can be served cold or hot and started shipping in january. our step-up in innovation has been a deliberate strategy and we expect it to be a competitive differentiator in years to come.
now i'd like to come back to our outlook. last evening, we reaffirmed our full-year guidance. our performance to date gives us a bias to the high side of our range. however, the cadence is a bit more backloaded than our initial outlook, but i want to provide some additional color.
we had a strong q1 and january consumption is off to a great start, with premier protein shakes growing 48% in tracked channels and nontracked growing even faster. however, we have become aware of changes within our customers' promotional calendars, which will shift revenue from q2 to q3 and four, slightly heavier to q4. with this change, in addition to our planned step-up in marketing and promotional spend, we expect our net sales and ebitda to be a bit more backloaded than previously anticipated. overall, i am pleased with our performance during our first quarter as a publicly traded company.
i'm excited about our new advertising and innovation hitting the market and i look forward to updating you next quarter. thank you for your continued support. and i'm going to now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. as darcy mentioned earlier in her remarks, we had a good first quarter and the results were generally in line with our expectations. net sales grew 31% to $244 million and adjusted ebitda increased 43% to $58.6 million, delivering an ebitda margin of 24%. our overall net sales growth was driven by premier protein, with net sales and volume increasing 45% and 38%, respectively.
this increase was fueled by growth for our ready-to-drink shakes, including distribution gains in fdm, club, and ecommerce. in addition, our shake growth benefited from the lapping of capacity constraints in the first quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted our prior-year net sales. dymatize net sales and volume declined 10% and 4%, respectively, driven by lapping a significant customer pipeline fill in the prior year. we continue to expect dymatize's performance to be stronger in the second half of the year.
powerbar net sales and volumes declined 12% and 28%, respectively, as we continue to see the impacts from our portfolio optimization strategy in north america. we expect to cycle the effect of this reduced powerbar distribution in the second half of fiscal 2020. turning back to consolidated results. gross profit increased 39% this quarter, with gross margin of 210 basis points to 37.4%.
gross margins benefited from higher net selling prices, favorable product mix, and lower freight offset partially by higher raw material cost. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 15% driven by higher warehousing costs, marketing spend, and incremental public and stand-alone company costs. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $58.6 million, an increase of 43%, with adjusted ebitda margin of 24%, an improvement of 190 basis points. our cash balance is approximately $30 million, resulting in net debt of $750 million and net leverage of 3.5 times.
our net leverage target remains 3.0 times and we plan to reach that in fiscal 2021. turning to fiscal 2020 guidance, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 net sales and adjusted ebitda to be $1.0 billion to $1.05 billion and $192 million to $202 million, respectively. however, as darcy mentioned earlier, we are expecting a shift in customers' promotional calendars for premier protein shakes, which will move anticipated revenue out of q2 and into the second half of the fiscal year. this revenue timing shift coupled with incremental q2 investments behind our national tv advertising campaign will cause both net sales and adjusted ebitda to be higher in the second half versus the first half of the fiscal year.
with that, i would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.
",2020-Q1,BRBR
0.9996,,,,":
operator
thank you. the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar of barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays capital -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning, everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays capital -- analyst
first off, darcy, as you mentioned, the trends in food and drug in tracked channels seems to be in good shape as is club or as are club and ecommerce in untracked. so it does seem like it's primarily mass in tracked channels that was some of the issue in some of the data that we all see in the scanner. if that's the case, is it primarily sort of promotional timing? or is there something else going on there? i am trying to get a sense of when we would expect to start to see some of that tracked data, which is heavily weighted, i think, toward mass, start to look improved.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so one of the things that we experienced during q3 was that covid hit club and mass harder than the other channels. consumers stayed away from the larger stores in favor of smaller local grocery stores and ecommerce. so there is one category aspect of that and we are already seeing that change and improve.
specific to our brands, we are -- specifically, in july, we're seeing improvement across consumption. but specifically, in july, we are lapping promotional timing in both tracked club and mass, and that should turn around later in the quarter.
andrew lazar -- barclays capital -- analyst
got it. great. that's helpful. and then when we think about trial and repeat, you've obviously talked about the impressive household penetration gains and sort of that 50% or so repeat rate.
just as you think, therefore, if we think forward a little bit, is there any other research or data points that you've got as you tally up what consumers are telling you that makes you feel like that type of repeat rate or there's a stickiness, if you will, right, of some of this incremental household penetration can be not insignificant if we think forward going into your fiscal '21?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the biggest predictor of the future is the past. and one of the things i mentioned in my prepared remarks is, we included a supplemental deck on our website that goes through some of our key metrics and goes back in time to give you a broader perspective, and one of the pages that follows household trends from 2016 to now. and you basically see almost doubling of household penetration, but our repeat rate stays consistent at around 50%.
and so i think that right there, i mean, when you increase household penetration, you usually see a decrease in repeat, but we haven't. so for us, our challenge and opportunity has always been to increase household penetration because 6.6 is great growth from 2016, but it's still relatively low in the broader scheme. and we're confident that we'll get the repeat and the loyalty because we've shown that the brand has some of the strongest in the category.
andrew lazar -- barclays capital -- analyst
thanks so much, darcy.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ken goldman of j.p. morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to dig in a little bit more toward guidance. obviously, you made changes to your sales number, but now your ebitda number, and you gave us some reasons why.
but was there any consideration to maybe given some of the downside surprise this quarter, potentially take the opportunity to take ebitda down a little bit as well, just to give yourself a little bit of cushion? or do you really feel like there's just that much visibility into your cost structure and the related sales that you feel it just wasn't necessary?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so we absolutely evaluated it. as you know, we overachieved the first half, and our ebitda margins have been running toward the high end of our long-term algorithm. and both of those things gave us some ebitda flexibility. and then in addition, when we entered into this pandemic, we ensured that we maintained some financial flexibility within our p&l, just in case that our forecast, our sales forecast, were slightly off.
so in many ways, we were ready for this because we wanted to deliver on our annual commitment of ebitda. so i feel confident we have good visibility into q4 already. and that's the main reason why we didn't adjust it.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and then i wanted to follow up with asking about your sku assortment. you had talked, darcy, about some of the products, the oat product doing very well. was there any pressure from your customers to reduce skus by a more meaningful amount than you would have hoped for or expected during the crisis so far? or given your limited number of products already, was that something you didn't quite feel as much of?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. there really was no pressure around sku assortment.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
short and sweet. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of david palmer of evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
just looking at your advertising and consumer marketing, the spending for the first nine months, it looks like that was up almost 200 basis points to the percentage of sales, which i think that was similar to what you would have thought, but although i remember the promotion and advertising was supposed to be going up 300 basis points. so could you comment on your gross spending year-to-date? is it in line with what you were going to spend? and do you still plan on spending that same sort of step-up in the fourth quarter? and then looking into '21, are you thinking similar amounts of gross spending? in other words, there need not be another step-up or maybe even -- you don't even need to have the same level in that year and i have a quick follow-up.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
great. i'll hit the strategy. and then if paul has anything specific to add, he will. from a strategy standpoint, our plan from a&p standpoint was always to focus our biggest spend in q2, which is around new year new you, when most people are entering the category and then we are going to have a smaller spend in the back half.
we chose to move that smaller spend into q3 and spend it in q3 because we felt like we had a very strong promotional plan in q4. and candidly, we are seeing softness in the category. and we also saw benefits on cheaper advertising rates, more eyeballs, etc. so, overall, from the year, our media spend is very similar to what we expected.
and just to specify, but in q4, we will have a small a&p budget because of our heavy promotional spend. on the '21 question, we saw this was our first year with television advertising. it was very effective in building household penetration, which was our main goal. so we expect and plan to increase that in '21.
and, obviously, we're in the process of doing that planning right now.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
as we're looking into '21, there's many gives and takes here with regard to how we should think about your top line. you're kind of unlucky with a lot of the on-the-go this year. but then again, you're lapping some out-of-stock issues or supply chain issues. and then god knows how things will work as far as the recovery rate of on-the-go into this next year.
so how are you thinking about the major chunks of gives and takes as we try to model fiscal '21, particularly as regard to the top line? thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think we're in the position right now to talk in detail on '21, which we will obviously do in the next quarter, but we are seeing improved category trends in july. so although the recovery took longer than we predicted, it was actually only about a month different than what we predicted. so we are seeing the july liquid category up above pre-covid levels.
so in many ways, although there are no promises with covid, but in many ways, we believe we are back to having the category tailwind. we know what works to drive our business, and it's kind of back to our original playbook.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jason english of goldman sachs.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, folks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
darcy, your performance this quarter definitely cost a little bit flat-footed in terms of the magnitude of decline. but your forecast for next quarter implies a pretty robust snapback. i think at the midpoint of your guidance implies around 23% growth, roughly speaking. i'm hearing you referenced consumption in july of around 12 on premier.
i'm assuming international, dymatize, powerbar, is still down. so somewhere in the mid- to high-single-digit overall consumption for the portfolio in aggregate. and tell me if i'm off base there. if that is generally right, what's going to drive the incremental growth to get to that 23%-type level in the fourth quarter?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so you're exactly right that we're expecting continued declines in the international business, so specifically dymatize, powerbar. but we are expecting to see pretty robust growth in premier shakes specifically. and that's really driven by promotions that we have in almost every single major account, as well as the category rebound of being more of a tailwind than it has been.
i think that what is encouraging is, at this point in the quarter, we actually have very good visibility to at least 2/3 of our quarter from a shipments perspective. and candidly, that is what's giving us confidence.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
ok. the only thing i would add quickly is that, recall that we were also lapping some pretty good old favorable comp in the fourth-quarter prior year because of the early load into q3. so that is about 9% benefit to the fourth quarter.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and for my follow-up, i'm going to try to cheat a little bit here and squeeze two questions in, so my apologies. and i know jennifer is going to punish me later for it. but first, the volatility of the business, i mean, from up 32% to up 19% to down 14% to up 23%, and that's just this year, and we see the volatility going back.
is there ever a scenario or a case where we don't have as much volatility going forward? is there anything you could do to manage the business for a little more consistency, i suppose? and then the second part of the question, which is totally unrelated, the cheat of the second question. i look around, the world does not feel anything like a post-covid world yet, and i'm not expecting a pre-covid world yet. i'm not expecting it to feel like a pre-covid world for quite some time. why should we expect your business to perform at pre-covid-type levels for any time in the next six months, even though it may have hit that level in july? why should we believe it will be durable?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great questions. ok. i'll hit the first one around consistency.
so our business is just naturally -- because we have some club concentration, we have a natural kind of lumpiness in our quarter-to-quarter. however, what we are, and hopefully you guys have had a chance to look at that supplemental deck, is by providing more transparency to what we usually see quarter-by-quarter, our goal is that you guys start understanding that it actually can be more predictable. this year, not predictable, obviously. and even last year, we had our capacity constraints, but there should be some predictability around promotions.
because, in essence, the difference between quarter-to-quarter is usually just promotional loads and deloads. so that's the first piece. the second piece is just around -- i agree, it does not feel like we are in a post-covid world. i think some of the dynamics that are unique to our category, specifically when i -- so when you think about convenient nutrition, the on-the-go piece and bars have definitely gotten hit the most.
i mean, in the quarter, bars were down 24%, where rtds were only down 4%. what's happening within rtds is, i feel, even in july, where it is up 7% versus pre-covid levels of 6%, i think there are some unique things happening. one, i still believe that the on-the-go use education is still under-indexing. people are not out and about like they were before.
however, the in-home use is over-indexing. and what we're seeing is some new trends around food as medicine or proactive health. and that is really benefiting the adult nutrition side of our business, but it's also benefiting our side of the business, the everyday nutrition side of the business. it's hurting weight management and sports nutrition, but i think those are some of the dynamics where our business actually can benefit, candidly, from kind of a post-covid or a covid world.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you very much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson of jefferies.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you so much. so i guess kind of a follow-up to the color you just made in terms of maybe seeing some benefit at-home consumption around use of kind of as a medicine equivalent, so to speak. if i remember correctly, i thought in the last call, you would discuss health, how maybe a decent percentage of your overall buyer base actually consumes the product at home.
right? so not all on-the-go. and obviously, primarily buying that in the cross-channel. so i guess the question i would have is, if that consumer base relative to, let's say, other consumer bases within the category consumed more at home, is there something you can do to essentially support ongoing food at-home consumption of your product and/or potentially shift or think about adjacencies, call it, confection, snacks, what have you?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. so you're exactly right. we see about 80%, 85% of our business consumed in the house or at home, and what we're doing is, like many other cpgs, as we're evaluating this change of consumer behavior and adjusting.
so we've adjusted our communication strategy. we did it right away to focus more about using our products and recipes, which has always been very successful on social. obviously, we adjusted our a&p strategy. i think, as we go forward, we are looking at different ways we can kind of renovate or use packaging call-out on our packages, to call out certain benefits that we have to really leverage some of these trends.
and then on the longer standpoint, we are definitely looking at product ideas that would be leveraging some of the trends that i already talked about.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and then, secondly, just speaking with a number of people within the industry and more specifically around your category, there's a feel that was kind of brewing that, as you kind of go into shelf resets later this year, that retailers overall are still kind of supporting some of the larger brands. right? i mean, this is the case across all of food, but more specifically just in your category.
and given there's so many players, right, within a higher-growth category like sports nutrition, especially on the bar side, the feel is that, well, maybe some of the larger players could actually benefit through their shelf reset. now i realized you're focused more on club, maybe the reset isn't adjacent to seeing even as consistent or is a little bit different, but how do you feel about your share gain potential as we go through this process and as you are promoting heavily, right, and as you are trying to expand that household penetration further?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i'm really excited about the upcoming resets. and specifically, i think, in the past, i've talked about kind of 50% of the shelf sets reset in the fall, 50% in the spring. second change to be more of a 60-40 split.
and so we have visibility to the new resets that are coming up in our q1. and i think what you explained about retailers supporting the larger brands, specifically the larger growing brands, i think that our resets will show you that. and we're gaining some significant space, which i would argue is long overdue, but i'm very excited to see it.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
that's great to hear. i'll pass it on. thank you so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question comes from the line of john baumgartner of wells fargo.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
hi, john.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
paul, i wanted to connect to the gross margins. just given the pressure this quarter, the pressure last quarter, the outsourced model, you're not seeing as much deleverage as you would have if it was in-sourced. and could you drill down a bit more into the components there of that pressure? you mentioned the cost inflation in your comments, between cost inflation change in year-on-year promo, maybe just more detail there. and then as a follow-up, with the dislocations from covid, how is that impacting any sort of changes in your outlook for dairy cost inflation going forward? thanks.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure. yeah. so from a third-quarter perspective versus last year, you're correct, our margins were down.
and it's really two primary components: it is the increased promotional spend, as well as the increase in milk protein cost. so it's kind of 60-40 split really from the drivers on the margin side. as we look into next year, dairy costs have been somewhat volatile since kind of after covid. we were expecting higher protein costs as we went into fiscal '21.
that's been a little bit tempered based on the markets recently, but we're still expecting some minor headwinds on the milk protein side. on whey protein, actually, those have been a bit more favorable, not increasing and so there may be a marginal benefit there. but any protein costs for next year, our thinking is that, with some of our supply chain initiatives, there are opportunities to offset some of that. but we do think there will be some modest headwinds for protein as we go into next year.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and is there any ability to, i guess, maybe hedge more than you had historically? any changes in the supply chain initiatives on that front? or is still just historical to be the norm in terms of, i guess, leaving up more to chance as opposed to hedging?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. we're evaluating several strategies. at any given time, we're looking at different ways to do that. and we have, even in this fiscal year, implemented some different strategies than we have executed in the past.
and we're continuing to explore some additional opportunities there. so yes, we're continuing to evaluate to find the best way to mitigate that.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. thanks paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks.

our next question comes from the line of pamela kaufman of morgan stanley. pamela, make sure you're not on mute. our next question comes from the line of brian holland of d.a. davidson.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
most of my questions have been answered, so maybe just two quick kind of follow-ons. one, darcy, it sounds like, from everything you're saying, that you have pretty good line of sight on distribution gains amid the upcoming shelf reset, which is certainly encouraging to hear, given the kind of the landscape and some uncertainty going in about how shelf reset timing was going to play out. so maybe just first point of clarification, do you feel very comfortable with the line of sight you have on distribution gains going into fall?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we do. we have some minor reset happening in the grocery side of the business in q4, but the major ones we will see in our q1. and, yes, we already know where those will land, and it's positive for our brand.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. got it. and then just quickly on the scanner data. obviously, some scrutiny there that's been referenced throughout the call, and you did a great job of walking through the puts and takes there.
but just to help us understand, as we watch this data over the next few months, i know you lapped some material promotional events in the prior-year period, just taking the covid backdrop out of this, as we look forward over the next couple of months, no significant events that we are lapping that maybe won't be repeated that we should just be mindful of one way or the other that might impact the way the scanner would look?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i always want to be careful with none, but no major ones. if you remember, so last year, we actually only did -- we did only a handful of promotions, specifically in our club accounts. and we have a small promotion in mass, which we're lapping right now. but what's different about this year is we basically have promotions in almost all of our different retailers.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
appreciate the color, best of luck.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

our next question comes from the line of bill chappell of truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
first question, i just want to go back to the third quarter, the inventory or the trade inventory issue. i'm just trying to understand, did we just mismodel that? or did it happen a little different than expected? because i think i was going back, and i think the comment was it was expected to be kind of a $50 million hit to demand equally over the next two quarters, but it seems like majority of it happened in 3q. so did something happen differently? or did we just not get the message?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think there are two things. so we did our best to communicate the high customer inventory at the end of q2, which benefited q2, but hurt q3, and that when you're looking at the back half, it was back-loaded to q4. clearly, we need to do a better job because we look back at the scripts, and we thought we were clear, but clearly not.
so we can work on that for sure. what we meant was and what was the new information is the rate of recovery of the category. and that was what i was talking about kind of the w. i mean if you go back to the overall convenient nutrition category, but specifically liquids, you'll see week on week that it hit a low in april.
and then toward the end of april, the category actually saw a steady recovery. we expected at that time with the information we had that that would continue gradually up to pre-covid levels as of june. obviously, that actually went back down, and that was that w curve that i talked about. so that was really, honestly, the miss, as opposed to we had visibility to, obviously, the high customer inventories.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and kind of follow-up on the same lines, like what are your kind of current thoughts for active nutrition as we come out of covid? and the reason i say that is, as you saw, as your numbers were declining, i mean, sales of ketchup and frozen potatoes were tripling. and so clearly, there are consumers that have gone to comfort food and are still on comfort food and just didn't know if you thought it would race back? is everybody trying to shed the pounds and be more active and nutritious coming out of this? or whether there's kind of a permanent pause on some of the active nutrition growth as people slowly come out of it?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i mean, big picture, from a trend perspective, there's the temporary piece, which is really this on-the-go reduction. so that, i think, will continue, once there's a vaccine, even it's starting to come back, i think, as we're all learning more about the virus and understanding how to function with it. so i think that is a temporary piece that we're already starting to improve.
i think that, when you look at need state, the area that is benefiting is adult nutrition and somewhat everyday nutrition. what's getting hit is weight management and sports nutrition. i believe that those will come back. so sports nutrition has been hit for a while, but i believe they will come back, i think, as people start wanting to get back into their health routines, etc.
so the fundamentals of this category are strong. people are looking to improve their health. they want convenience. so i have no doubt that this category will rebound.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for the color.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of ken zaslow of bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
how does this affect your long-term growth rate?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it doesn't. so if you remember, we had planned our long-term algorithm, we had planned to have a higher growth rate this year because we were lapping the sku constraints, but the long term was 10% to 12% growth with 18% to 20% ebitda margins. and actually, what we're seeing because of covid is we are actually still delivering on that long-term algorithm. however, we thought we would be over-delivering this year.
ken zaslow -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. my second question is, when you did the promotional shift from second quarter to third quarter and fourth quarter, how did that play out? and then i'll leave it there.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
the promotional shift?
ken zaslow -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. and two quarters ago, you said that you were delaying the promotions from the second quarter to the third and fourth, unless i made a mistake and misread the transcript. is that not the case?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
no, you're right. yes, no, no, no, you're right. so a couple of things happened. so we actually, this last quarter, because of -- so those moved to q4 and actually into q1.
but what changed in this quarter is we actually ended up doing an incremental promotion because in our club accounts, mainly because our club accounts saw the declining category and we were their first call. so net-net, we actually ended up with the same amount of promotions in this year even though we thought they were moving.
ken zaslow -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, i'll leave everything for later. thank you very much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our final question comes from the line of chris growe of stifel.
matt smith -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
this is matt smith, on for chris. my first question relates to the inventory position at retail. could you talk about what happens in the fourth quarter? when i look at the bars on the slide that you provided, it looks like there's potentially more inventory deloading to go.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
paul, do you want to take that?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
of course. yeah. coming out of the third quarter, we feel like the inventory levels are in balance at our key customers where we have full visibility, so we do not anticipate the fourth quarter having significant deviations between shipments and consumption.
matt smith -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. and then my follow-up would be, as it relates to the household penetration and repeat rates that you provided, could you talk about the benefit of new products and how those are impacting repeat rates? and then on tdps, are there varying repeat rates based on the new products that are influencing the performance?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so there are a few things that kind of you expect with repeat rates is that as you expand distribution and you expand households is that your both buy rate and repeat rate would go down. i think that's one of the things that i was saying at the very beginning is, that's what i'm really excited about is that we actually see a very stable repeat rate over the years. so that feels really good.
and with regards to buy rate, we are seeing some decline in buy rate, mainly just because we're going from big packs in clubs to smaller packs in fdm, but still very strong. so i think i answered your question. did i get everything?
matt smith -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you.

darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you all for joining us this morning. last evening, we reported our third-quarter results, as well as posted a supplemental presentation to our website. this presentation is designed to provide more insight into our business, consumption and key metrics. we reported third-quarter sales of $204 million and adjusted ebitda of $38.5 million.
as we discussed last quarter, we ended q2 with inflated trade inventories after our customers overbought following the mid-march consumer stock-up. this elevated q2 sales at the expense of q3 and factored into our second-half planning. in reaffirming guidance in may, we highlighted that the second half would be backloaded warded. more specifically, we expected roughly 56% of our second-half revenue to fall into the fourth quarter.
with july net sales coming in at close to $100 million, this plan is proving out. outside of the timing shift, our actual results were shy of our internal expectations, mainly due to a slower-than-expected rtd category recovery as a result of less on-the-go occasions. specifically, we forecasted a consistent improvement from the april low reaching pre-covid levels by june. instead, we saw more of a w-shaped recovery, with may dipping back down and not reaching pre-covid levels until after the quarter ended in july.
coupled with longer-than-expected international recovery, this shaves $50 million to $60 million from our second-half sales forecast, which is equally split between q3 and q4. although we are seeing encouraging signs in the july rtd category consumption period, we lowered our q4 growth assumptions given the choppy recovery we experienced in q3. however, because of the overperformance in the first half, combined with nonstrategic sg&a reductions in the back half of the year, we still expect to deliver our full-year ebitda in line with our original expectations. i'd like to now focus on brand highlights, progress against our growth strategies and end with our outlook.
despite strong covid category headwinds, premier protein shake consumption was strong this quarter, up 11% across both tracked and untracked channels. untracked outpaced tracked channels, growing 33% in the quarter, while tracked declined 4.5%. ecommerce, premier protein's third largest channel, led the way, up an amazing 185%. we also saw terrific growth in food and drug, up 38% and 33%, respectively, driven by distribution and increased marketing and promotion.
july consumption has remained strong, up 12% in tracked and untracked channels. untracked continues to drive our growth, up 39%, while tracked channels faced headwinds in july due to promotional timing shifts that will reverse later in the quarter. now to our growth strategies. strong marketing programs continue to be drivers for the brand.
premier protein increased two share points in the quarter to 18% of the rtd category. our promotional strategy remains effective, driving approximately 40% of our consumption growth and tdps continue to increase, up 6% in the quarter. premier protein household penetration substantially increased year-to-date to 6.6%, supported by media, including television advertising. our new products continue to perform well and are gaining distribution.
cafã© latte and our powder product velocities are ranked in the top 10% of the category. protein with oats continues to sell well, and we have gained expanded distribution, which we will see in the next two quarters. i'm excited about our pipeline of new products coming out over the next several months, including welcoming back my personal favorite, pumpkin spice, that ships this month. now to our other brands.
dymatize's domestic business had a good quarter, up 9%, led by club and ecommerce. our launch of iso100 cocoa and fruity pebbles had quickly shown success, ranking in the top 10 skus where it is sold. unfortunately, both dymatize and powerbar's international businesses continue to be challenged as a result of covid. our supply chain remains stable.
during the quarter, we successfully brought online a fifth co-manufacturing location. this was challenging given the covid environment, and i'm proud of our team's hard work on this achievement. this additional capacity gives us further flexibility to support our growth plans. now to our outlook.
that pandemic has created strong category headwinds, and the slower-than-expected recovery has affected both of our domestic and international businesses. as a result, we have lowered our back-half sales; however, despite those challenges, we still expect to deliver double-digit net sales growth for the year. in q4, we have significant growth drivers lined up, including promotions in most major retailers, expanded distribution, and we already have a strong july in the books. given we exceeded our expectations for the first two quarters and are we confident in our ability to achieve our q4 forecast, i'm happy to reaffirm our full-year ebitda guidance.
i'm incredibly proud of our company, and i don't want to miss the opportunity to publicly thank all of our employees and our co-manufacturing partners for navigating this stressful time. i continue to have confidence in our brand fundamentals, and i'm energized by the business momentum, expanded distribution, innovation pipeline and our long runway for growth. i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. net sales for the quarter were $204 million and adjusted ebitda was $38.5 million. third-quarter results, as anticipated, were pressured by the impact of covid, as well as changes in customer inventory levels when compared to prior year. covid impacted our quarterly net sales results on several fronts.
first, it took longer for retailers to reduce their on-hand rtd shake inventory from inflated levels at the beginning of the quarter. second, as darcy detailed, the rtd liquid category had significant headwinds. third, our international business, which historically has accounted for 50% of our net sales declined significantly compared to last year. though we anticipated many of these impacts, the category recovery was slower than expected.
from a shipment perspective, premier protein net sales declined 12%, with rtd shake net sales down 10%. the disconnect between shipments and our strong 11% consumption growth for rtd shakes was largely expected. shipment delayed consumption as retailers worked through an overbuy in march. additionally, recall we lapped last year's pull-forward shipments related to a fourth-quarter promotion.
these inventory related headwinds were partially offset by strong distribution gains across channels. dymatize has strong growth in the club and ecommerce channels, which combined grew 50% in the quarter. we anticipated strong growth for these channels in the second half, and the brand continues to gain distribution in fdm and club while consistently delivering double-digit growth within ecommerce. this growth was outlaid by covid-driven declines globally for the specialty business, resulting in an overall net sales decline of 16.6%.
powerbar net sales declined 44%, reflecting the impacts from our portfolio optimization strategy in north america and lower international volumes driven by specialty store closures. we expect covid to weigh on the brand's results in the fourth quarter, but the decline should moderate now that we have fully lapped the portfolio optimization strategy in north america. turning back to consolidated results. gross profit of $69 million declined 24% this quarter, with gross profit margin declining 450 basis points to 33.6%.
the margin decline related to anticipated higher input costs, primarily milk-based proteins, and a higher trade promotion rate. sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 240 basis points to 16%. this increase was driven by a strategic increase in marketing spend of $2 million and $2.1 million of incremental public company costs, offset partially by lower compensation expense. adjusted ebitda for the quarter was $38.5 million, a decrease of 37.1%, with an adjusted ebitda margin of 18.9%.
before reviewing our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on cash flow and liquidity. we had a strong third quarter for cash flow, generating $32 million from operations, and we repaid the $65 million we had borrowed under our revolver as a precautionary measure in light of the uncertainty covid created. this left us with $22.5 million of cash on hand and $145 million available under our revolver at quarter end. as of june 30, net debt was $715 million and net leverage was 3.8 times.
although this is an increase in leverage from last quarter, it is in line with our expectations given our quarterly adjusted ebitda compared to prior year. we still expect the end of fiscal year with materially lower net leverage and to reach our net leverage target of 3 times in fiscal 2021. turning to our outlook. we are pleased to reaffirm our fiscal year 2020 adjusted ebitda outlook of $192 million to $202 million.
however, based on lower second-half expectations due to covid, we have adjusted our net sales range to $960 million to $980 million. in spite of covid headwinds, the fourth quarter is expected to deliver strong double-digit top line growth driven by premier protein rtd shakes, which will benefit from distribution gains and incremental promotional activity. we anticipate the remainder of our brands will be weighed down by the lingering impacts of covid, especially the domestic and international specialty businesses. for dymatize, these headwinds are expected to more than offset continued strong gains in e-commerce, club and fdm.
overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong fourth-quarter results. category dynamics have improved from the third quarter and the fourth quarter is off to a great start as evidenced by our strong july net sales. premier protein, which is 80% of our net sales, has continued to register double-digit consumption growth in the face of covid, and we expect that growth trend to continue in q4. with that, i'd like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question is from ken goldman of jp morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you. i'm wondering if you could explain a little bit the reasoning behind the share buyback lately or that you authorized lately. is there anything to read into that other than why companies do share buybacks in general because it's sometimes a good use of capital? i think there's some speculation that maybe there's -- you'd be looking to buy from a particular holder, a particular large holder of bellring, but i'm just wondering if you could elaborate that a little bit because it has created some market speculation.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, good morning, ken. this was simply a tactical move to give us flexibility in a volatile market. so we have great -- as you guys know, we have great organic growth, and we generate strong cash flow. so it just seems prudent to keep all uses of cash open.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then, thank you for that. my follow-up would be, i just wanted to make sure i heard you correctly on the 1q sales growth number. i think you said it should be within your long-term range.
so are you looking for somewhere between 10% to 12% in that first quarter? and does that account for -- i'm sure it does, but just to make sure all of the puts and takes between difficult comparisons on shipments, maybe any reversal of 4q ship-in? just wanted to make sure i'm getting all that correct.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the context was that, obviously, we had higher growth in this last quarter. and yes, our q1 will be more in line with our long-term algorithm. expect with more outlook on the higher side.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. glad i asked. thank you.
operator
your next question is from andrew lazar of barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning, everybody.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
i want to dig into the sales guidance a little bit further. i think you expected first-half sales growth, high single digits; second half, mid-teens. if we take the low end of both of those ranges, i think, it gives us full-year sales growth at kind of roughly the midpoint of your full-year guidance. so i guess, what i'm getting at is the low end gets to sort of the midpoint.
so it would seem to build in some level of conservatism, which i think in light of current dynamics and all the uncertainties makes sense. so i just wanted to get a sense from you darcy. how you're thinking about the sales growth rate for the year in sort of a prudent way? and if that's what gives you -- or what gives you the confidence to provide a full-year sales outlook, given all the uncertainty, would be the first one.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so yes, that math is correct. and that's where we see the year ending. i think that we want to be conservative. obviously, we have there's a lot of unknowns, but we have a lot of things going for us.
obviously, we have expanded. we have line of sight to resets in major accounts, as well as we have new products that are hitting that are early look is performing well. we're also lapping distribution gains from last year. and we are increasing our brand building, specifically our advertising, which we saw worked last year, and now we're just extending the time.
so we are feeling good about the top line and hitting that number.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then, it's a good segue into my next question, which is really just -- i don't know how much -- how specific you can get on some of the outcome of some of the shelf resets and such, but maybe any color or a little more detail on -- maybe how much space you've gained? or whether you think that was incremental to the category? or if it came from sort of other players or other subcategories? just trying to get a little more color on that, depending on what you can share. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes. so as i said last quarter, we gained -- in q4, we gained about 9% tdps, and it was mostly food accounts, whereas coming into q1, they are a major reset. so a large mass account, as well as club.
so in those, they're resetting now started at the beginning of november, and so you can go into stores and see it. we actually -- from a category standpoint, the category space generally stayed the same. it looks like there are some gains in liquid and powders at the expense of bars, but it is nominal. from a bellring standpoint, we gained a fair amount.
so we will more than double our space at a major mass account. so it's pretty exciting. and we gained with premier primarily but also with dymatize. what was also nice is we gained across forms.
so predominantly, we gained in shakes, as expected, but we also got powder in there, which is nice. and we're seeing really good gains on our powder business across food accounts. so that's nice to see.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
our next question is from john baumgartner of wells fargo.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. darcy, just hoping you could expand a bit on the marketing plan for fiscal '21? i mean, you're coming off a year of significant investment. so any thoughts on the roi would be great.
and then, looking ahead, what sort of contemplated for f '21 year on year? and how are you expecting the spend to tilt between advertising promo or other merchandising?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we were really pleased with our 2020 results from an advertising standpoint. we reach our main goal of the advertising was to increase penetration. and we hit our goal, our annual goal.
we actually hit it about midyear and then, as well as brand awareness, etc. so for '21, the strategy is, basically do more of what was working. so we're going to continue to spend in both tv and digital. we're going to expand the time.
so we felt like we had the right level of spend in q2, which, again, is new year, new to you for us. so the big -- the major time when new households come into the category will extend from four months to about seven months. and then, we'll be increasing spend in e-commerce. and then, display in store, so promo.
and then, obviously, we'll be -- we are also expanding space. so i would say what is new from a marketing standpoint is our focus on buy rate. so we're focused on both household, as well as buy rate. so that's where the upsizing comes in and then the increase in promo.
so a similar -- i would say, similar strategy from an advertising standpoint but just more of it.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok, thanks for that. and then, just to follow up on the innovation front. i guess, our sense is that your pipeline is already fairly substantial for the next few years. and you mentioned some of the new flavors.
but as covid persists and you see consumers gravitating toward more functional products, the ensure, the boost, how does that inform your views on the ability for premier to sort of go to different need states? i mean, can that brand travel? or do you think you have to grow through m&a, if you're going to kind of branch out to other functional types of areas? thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. this is where i think premier has a ton of advantage. i mean, one of the key differences about the premier protein brand versus, i would say, any other brand in the category is its ability to travel. so whereas many of the other brands are strong within their need state, they may be a weight management brand, they may be an adult nutrition brand or a sports nutrition brand, what premier does is, it fits squarely in not everyday nutrition, but it sources volume from all of the others.
so it gives us tremendous room to innovate and kind of lean into those spaces. and those are some of the areas that we're looking into. i mean, i think i talked about how covid has really uncovered a trend that was already in going on in the category around proactive health. and i think you're starting to see immunity claims across categories in the store but specifically in our area.
you'll see that later in the year on premier, but we'll start leaning into those ways to innovate. but obviously, m&a will -- we'll lean into m&a in any area that we feel premier can't go.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks, darcy. thanks for your time.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from brian holland of d.a. davidson.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning. wanted to ask a follow-up on andrew's question about shelf space and how that's evolved. and specifically, looking at private label, i think we've seen in the past that whether following slimfast or after that atkins, more recently, i was wondering if you're seeing them sort of mimic you on the 30-gram shake side.
how you're seeing that evolve? any new products there? and maybe how you're competing against that? and maybe more broadly, how is that playing out? what do you think that says about where you are as far as being on trend? because i think it's fine if private label is coming in. but if that's where the growth is in private label, it probably speaks to your leadership.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so private label represents about 8% of rtds, and it's up about 9%. it's pretty consistent. it's up a little bit more this quarter, but nothing dramatic.
the vast majority of that in tracked channels, so that's just in tracked channels. the vast majority of that is in walmart. and so we really -- premier has pretty low interaction with overall private label. we're about a 55% interaction index, so pretty low.
over the years, so because equate is such a strong brand in private label, they have products that compete in every single need state. so about two years ago, they launched a premier fighter. it really has not affected our business very much. and so i think that's a good example of a strong private label but has really not affected our business.
and so i think that as we look -- i knew you'd ask about new entrants, yes. so sam's recently launched a 30 -- kind of a 30-gram fighter. again, we're watching it. but again, based on equate, we really think that it -- we don't think that it will have a big impact on our business.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i appreciate the color, darcy. separately, a fair amount of cost inflation, obviously, hitting gross margin. it would appear as though you're limited on price as a total offset as you look to drive household penetration. so i'm wondering what you're looking at or what you're currently doing on the supply chain side to maybe help manage or smooth out some of this raw material and logistics pressures that you're seeing going forward?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
do you want me to tell -- i'll take this, paul, and then you can add on as you see fit. so yes. so yes, it's a conscious decision to not take price. we basically are seeing the increases in the -- more in the front half than we are in the back half as we are seeing kind of a spike in milk protein costs, as well as some logistic costs from covid.
so we are actively working on cost-out programs, both this year, as well as -- we started last year as -- we're doing it this year, and we're even expanding. we already have line of sight to projects that we're working on for '22 and beyond. but i think because we see the cost increases hitting mostly in the front half and kind of subsiding in the back half, and our focus on market share and brand building. we think we can weather this in kind of the first half.
the one thing i'd say, i'll say is we are watching it. i mean, if our calculus isn't correct and commodity prices increased more than expected, we took price february of '19. and the organization executed well. elasticity was as expected.
so we can always make that decision, and we are monitoring it closely.
operator
we'll go to our next question who is chris growe of stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. i just wanted to ask a question first on the gross margin, so a little bit on brian's question, but just to understand you had two major factors weigh on the gross margin sequentially and year over year, i guess, promotion -- you see promotional rebuild, as well as input cost inflation. is it possible to disaggregate that? and more importantly, i'm just trying to understand is kind of how much is ongoing? and how much kind of pressure, especially from inflation, we could see in the first half of the year?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. chris, your question, i assume, is on q4 margins, specifically?
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
so from a q4 perspective, you're right, there's two major items that were impacting margins, promotional activity and raw materials. raw materials was a bit more impactful than promotion. in fact, the fourth quarter was our highest impact from raw materials versus last year. so it's hitting a peak.
as we go into next year, darcy highlighted that, and we've highlighted, obviously, in our prepared remarks and earnings release that, we do expect raw material prices to impact us primarily in the first half with the most impact in the first quarter. keep in mind that last year in the first quarter, protein prices were just starting to rise. so we had some favorability that as the costs got higher in the rest of the year. so we're -- it's a little bit more of a headwind in the first quarter.
but really, it's the first half, it takes the brunt of the impact. it's very modest in the rest of the year, but it starts off highest in first quarter as it's better as we go through the year.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and i had just one other question, perhaps, for darcy, just in relation to the category growth rate, in particular, where you operate, and i'm thinking particularly in liquids, do you expect to see a growth profile much like you saw in 2020? or do you think -- although we've seen an uptick in the growth of the category, is it more like kind of where we exited fiscal '20 as we look ahead to fiscal '21? just trying to get a level set on kind of where the category shifts out for the year.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so historical growth rates for the category is about 5%. we're a little bit above that right now. and obviously, that dipped during q3 of last year.
but yes, i expect it to go back to historical, so about 5%. it's been very steady. so in the supplemental deck that we put out, we added a slide on the category that very clearly shows you the covid stock up, the deload and then just how steady the category has been back to pre-covid levels. so i expect that to continue.
obviously, there can be some bumps depending on lockdowns, etc. but overall, i think it will come back to -- it will be consistent with where it has been for the last three months.

your next question is from david palmer of evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. just a question on some of the dynamics we can see just in the measured channels, which i know is highly imperfect, but just from some of the standpoint that you're talking about with the immunity claims and one player like ensure that is doing well in the measured channels. it seems to be positioned against certain claims but also positioned against older demographics, and they may be benefiting from covid in certain unique ways, and perhaps you're going to go after those need states a little bit more with some of your messaging. but then with regard to some of your coverage, one of the beauties of your brand is it covers different need states.
and when you market against those in post-covid, weight management and on the go nutrition, particularly at breakfast, will be back. and i'm wondering how much of a headwind you think you have from covid on those need states such that, frankly, you'll just get some easy wins in the second half of your fiscal year, and i'll leave it there. thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so if you -- it's a good point of making sure that we look at what was going on last year because it was -- from quarter to quarter, it was very different. so when we look at lapping q2, you have to remember that in the last two weeks there was a massive spike in consumption, where -- and then conversely, in q3, the comps are easier. and then, q4 sort of got back to normal.
so those are exactly what we are expecting. you're absolutely right that ensure has been benefiting, benefiting probably the most in our category from covid. so i mean, they will, obviously, have some pretty hard comps. but like i said before, the beauty of the premier brand is, first of all, we market more generally.
we talk about a quick, easy, delicious, healthy breakfast, which honestly can travel across all these states. and so we believe that our marketing, which we've tested in market, obviously, last year, as well as tested quantitatively that it's hitting on all those need states, and so we think we'll make up some ground and source some volume from several of them.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
and i mean, just to follow up on that, do you think you've lost a chunk of business because there's less of that time-compressed on-the-go parent to maybe -- or the worker that needs to grab something and go? have you done any consumer research that shows how much you've lost on that need state?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we have lost on that need state. so the on-the-go, the quick breakfast, i think what's happening, though, is we're over-indexing on the at-home. so it's making up for it. so when we return to normal, i think that -- what will be -- what i don't have a perfect sense of is, do we keep that over-index at-home because people start getting used to having it as a snack in the middle of the day, as well as breakfast.
and then, do we add the on-the-go, so then making it -- so getting back those other need states. or does it swap? what i'm confident on is that we have new products, we have new distribution. we have all of these other building blocks that are working for us. but that's a piece that we'll honestly have to just watch.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question is from bill chappell of truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, darcy, just help us understand. i appreciate that you gave full-year guidance in a lot of uncertainty. but what have you seen over the past three months in terms of need states bouncing back or just trends? and just trying to understand how you're looking or how you're building that guidance, especially as we get to april, may, june, and there's so much uncertainty of what's open and not open? i mean, is it assuming some need states bounce back, is it -- and i guess, so two questions. one, what did you see over the past three months in terms of progression of sales from the different need states? and two, how did you build out the forecast for next year with the assumption of that some need states will come back at certain months?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we assumed that the category stays at kind of historical levels -- historic level. so that the category continues to grow around low single digits, so that was part of our assumptions. regarding need states, i would say that we don't necessarily build our forecast like that.
so i think that we are covered because we source volume from kind of all of them. we're, obviously, right in the everyday nutrition piece, but we source volume from the rest. i think how we build our forecast is, we take the assumption -- we use building blocks. so we take the assumption of the category growth rate.
then we add on new distribution, new products, lapping the prior-year new distribution. so that's where we are getting a bulk of our growth, and that's where we come up with what our guidance was.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. i guess, so just to clarify, like if you looked at july, august, september, was the sale -- the trends pretty similar throughout? or i mean, did you start to see -- i mean, there's been some thought that as we are coming out of the pandemic, people are tired of having the extra 10 pounds, they want to be a little more active. and so there should be a migration more to active nutrition. so did you see things start to accelerate toward the end of the quarter?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it was very stable. so i mean, again, like i kind of urge you to go to that slide on the supplemental because it is shockingly stable. throughout the entire -- so basically, after we rebounded, they had that de-load in q3. q4 in the category was pretty flat.
i mean, some small changes but overall, very flat.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the color.

your next question is from ken zaslow of bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
can i ask a different line of questioning? what do you guys think about the co-packing capacity out there? is there constraints to that? and doesn't that limit the number of entrants? and have you seen that change?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes, there absolutely are constraints out there. it has changed. so as supply and demand, the co-packers have added capacity, mostly a line here or there. obviously, we have a new co-manufacturer on the east coast, so that added capacity.
so i would say that it's not as limited as it once was. however, other than the co-manufacturer we added, there are no new players. it's just a matter of the existing players adding a line here or there.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then, my second question is, as you look through your supply chain, this has given a lot of people an examination of, ok, what we could do differently, how we could do it. this is the covid shock, however you want to call it. what have you learned from the supply chain? is there opportunities for you to become more efficient and actually gain a couple of margin points here and there as you exit this? or is this something -- i know you've never been a real margin story, it's a top-line story, but can you give us any insight to that?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we have been digging into our supply chain, for sure, as i know most companies are. especially because we were facing commodity cost increases, and we wanted to drive the top line. so we were doing whatever we can to offset some of those increases.
i mean, just think of, in the past, like you said, we have been a top-line story. so we haven't dug in deep. so we're looking at network design to make that more efficient. i mean, a big part of expanding our co-man network was to put a location on the east coast, which helps with our network design.
but we are looking at everything from packaging to the way we buy, to where we buy, to how we ship. i mean, across the board, we're evaluating, and we're making good inroads on that to offset some of these cost increases.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
do you think they're going to be permanent? and are we going to see a noticeable change or any change of any sort of -- and i'm not talking about next year, i'm just talking about over the next couple of years?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think that what right now is covered up by our cost by the commodity increases, honestly. if we hadn't had some of these, it would be larger. but those will stay.
obviously, these cost out initiatives will -- are permanent. so we'll see those, and they'll be more evident as we -- as the commodity prices increase -- decrease.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. look forward to seeing you. thank you very much. stay safe.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. last evening, we reported our fourth-quarter and fiscal 2020 results, as well as posted a supplemental presentation to our website. this presentation provides more insight into our business, consumption and key metrics. we finished 2020 strong with record net sales for the quarter at $283 million, up 32%, and adjusted ebitda of $57 million.
for the year, net sales grew to $988 million, slightly exceeding our revised sales guidance with adjusted ebitda of $197 million. despite the challenges that covid created, we exceeded our long-term algorithm and delivered net sales growth of 16%. adjusted ebitda came in at the midpoint of our original guidance, and we delivered strong cash flow generation, reducing our net leverage. i'm proud of our accomplishments in our first year as a public company, and specifically, for the resilience our employees demonstrated throughout a challenging year.
this morning, i'll review the category, brand highlights, growth strategies and end with our fiscal '21 outlook. the convenient nutrition category has been stable since mid-june, although below pre-covid levels as a result of less on-the-go usage mainly due to nutrition bars. across the category, we are seeing fewer shopping trips, higher basket sizes and the category continues to shift to e-commerce and food channels. our main segments, liquids and powders, have rebounded to their pre-covid growth rates.
however, the virus has impacted the category segments differently. adult and everyday nutrition brands continue to gain share driven by higher in-home usage. weight management has suffered as consumers move to comfort foods, while sports nutrition brands are primarily flat as consumers figure out new ways to exercise outside the gym. premium protein shake consumption improved this quarter, up 20% across tracked and untracked channels.
growth was strong across all of our key channels, club, mass, food and e-commerce. effective promotional programs, along with distribution gains and healthy velocities drove consumption growth. untracked channels continued to outpace tracked up 38%, while tracked returned to growth this quarter. this strong momentum has continued in q1, with the first six weeks showing 21% growth across tracked and untracked channels, with impressive gains in food, mass and e-commerce.
we made great progress against our growth strategies this year. premier protein household penetration reached 6.8%, gaining 1 percentage point this year. our distribution continues to increase with brand tdps up 9% sequentially and 26% for the year. we now have an average of 6.7 items on shelf.
we're pleased with the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities and look forward to building on our success in '21. our new products continue to excite both consumers and retailers. our seasonal offering, pumpkin spice, drove strong velocities across both e-commerce and retail outlets. our newest 30-gram flavored cinnamon roll shipped at the end of the fourth quarter and quickly sold out across e-commerce platforms.
we also started to ship a new pack size, 12-count, to the mass channel at the end of the quarter. this is a major '21 initiative for us because larger pack sizes represent a quarter of the fdm category. we're excited to give consumers the option to buy larger packs anywhere they shop, and early results are promising. dymatize had a fantastic quarter up 57% domestically, with growth across all channels.
our new products iso100 fruity and cocoa pebbles have vastly exceeded our expectations, becoming the no. 3 and no. 5 flavors within the iso100 line. we are quickly gaining distribution across all channels on these exciting new products.
our international business was relatively flat due to covid but showed strong sequential improvement, up 50% versus last quarter. premier shakes in canada drove most of the gains, while dymatize and powerbar continue to be challenged within the global specialty channel. our supply chain performed well all year, executing best-in-class service in the midst of unexpected volatility. our frontline employees in our germany plant and within our logistics and co-manufacturing network were invaluable to our success.
our fifth and newest co-manufacturer is performing well, and our shake network remains well-positioned to support our growth plans. now to our outlook. as you saw in yesterday's press release, we expect fiscal '21 net sales to grow 8% to 13% and adjusted ebitda to grow between 5% and 10%. this guidance is consistent with our long-term algorithm of 10% to 12% net sales growth at 18% to 20% ebitda margin.
ebitda growth lagged sales growth because we are choosing to invest in brand building and our commodity and logistics costs are running higher year over year. despite the higher cost, we are prioritizing driving share in a growing market. we believe now is the time to bring new households into the category rather than maximizing immediate margin. we will do that through increased strategic media and promotional spending, stronger creative, execution of premier proteins, upsize initiatives and continued flavor expansion.
as a result of the increased investment, we expect the timing of ebitda growth to be entirely in the back half. this is due to strong q2 media spend, raw material and logistics headwinds in the front half, and lapping covid demand shifts. overall, i'm very confident in our expansion plans for 2021 as we increase investments, grow our brand awareness and continue to generate strong cash flow. the rtb and powder categories have stabilized and are growing at pre-covid levels.
our household penetration is increasing. we are gaining significant distribution on both existing and new products. our marketing and promotional strategies are working, and our supply chain is well-positioned to support our growth. although we continue to face challenges with covid, i continue to be energized by our potential and our long runway for growth.
i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. net sales for the quarter was $282.6 million, up 32%. adjusted ebitda was $56.7 million, up 22.5%, and ebitda margin was 20.1%. premier protein net sales increased 37%, with rtd shake net sales up 40%.
fourth-quarter results benefited from favorable trade inventory changes in both 2019 and 2020. excluding these items, our underlying growth largely tracked consumption growth of 20%, driven by distribution gains for both existing and new products and incremental promotional activity. we continue to expect this brand to grow double digits, aided by gains in distribution and investments in promotions and marketing. dymatize net sales grew 15% this quarter, driven by strong increases in e-commerce, club and mass.
international sales for both dymatize and powerbar improved sequentially but remained challenged as a result of covid. turning back to consolidated results. gross profit of $90 million increased 17% this quarter, with gross profit margin declining 400 basis points to 31.8%. the margin decline was related to anticipated higher input cost, primarily milk-based proteins and incremental promotional activity.
sg&a expenses were flat, compared to prior year but declined 390 basis points as a percentage of net sales to 12.5%. higher employee-related expenses of $3 million and incremental public company costs of $1.8 million were partially offset by lower ipo costs of $2.7 million. marketing spend was flat compared to prior year. turning to full-year 2020 results.
net sales of $988 million grew 16% over the prior year, with gross profit of $338 million, growing 8%. gross profit margins declined 230 basis points to 34.2%, reflecting higher input costs and incremental promotional activity. sg&a as a percentage of net sales was 15.4%. adjusted ebitda of $197.2 million was relatively flat compared to prior year, with margins declining 320 basis points to 20% and included $8.7 million of incremental public company costs.
before reviewing our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on cash flow and liquidity. we had a strong fourth quarter for cash flow, generating $70 million from operations and $97 million for the year. we repaid $25 million of revolver borrowings in the quarter, leaving us with $49 million of cash on hand and $170 million available under our revolver at quarter end. as of september 30, net debt was $655 million and net leverage was 3.3 times.
since the ipo, we have reduced net debt by $82 million. we expect to reach net leverage of three times in fiscal 2021. we recently announced a $60 million stock repurchase authorization, and we'll continue to utilize our asset allocation decisions to enhance long-term shareholder value. turning to our outlook.
we expect fiscal 2020 net sales of $1.07 billion to $1.12 billion and adjusted ebitda of $207 million to $217 million. the midpoint of our outlook implies double-digit top-line growth and ebitda margins above 19%, both of which are in line with our long-term algorithm. our ebitda growth is expected to lag our top-line growth as we invest behind our brands and experienced input cost inflation, the latter of which is expected to be most impactful in the first half and moderate in the second half. similar to 2020, we expect promotional activity and advertising investments to peak in the second quarter and meaningfully pressure margins.
these timing items combined with covid's impact on our fiscal 2020 quarterly gating is expected to result in high single-digit sales growth in the first half and mid-teens growth in the second half. in addition, our ebitda growth is expected to be entirely in the second half. heading into the first quarter, we expect our sales growth rate to moderate in line with our long-term algorithm. consistent with the first -- consistent with past first quarters, we expect to benefit from shipments occurring ahead of consumption for premier protein shakes as retailers build inventories to support january promotions.
we expect our first-half quarterly ebitda pacing to closely track 2020. last, giving consideration of both bellring inc.'s taxes and distributions to post holdings, bellring's total income tax cash outflows are expected to be approximately $34 million in 2021. we expect cash interest expense to be approximately $40 million. with that, i would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of ken goldman of j.p. morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thank you, and i love the 11 minutes of prepared remarks. it's fantastic. so thank you for keeping it brief for everybody. i wanted to ask about the gross margin, which, of course, was down a significant amount this quarter for the third straight time.
i get it right? you're facing a spike in dairy and freight, you've been promoting some more in some channels. i'm just wondering because i think investors, and we certainly are guilty of this, have been modeling in much stronger gross margins. what can you tell us specifically? is there any way you can quantify what your expectations are for that line for the next few quarters or just for the year, just in the name of sort of making sure that we don't get those negative surprises on that line item again?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
sure ken. good morning. i'll take that. yes.
so coming into the year, we expected our gross margins to decline versus last year, because of -- especially the first half was impacted more so by protein cost, and we expected to continue to make brand investments and promotional spending. so we expected gross margins to decline versus last year. what has changed, obviously, is freight cost has increased. and so that's putting more pressure on our margins in the first half.
so, while overall for the year, we expect our margins to be down versus last year, we now expect that our second half should be above last year's gross margins because of the price increase, offsetting some of these costs. so, first half down; second half above last year. keep in mind, our historical margins have been roughly around 34% with a spike in '19 because of the price increase we took at that point in time where they got a little bit above 34%, but historically, we've been about around there. so we -- we expect to get closer to that as we take the price increase going into next year.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. that is very helpful. thank you. and then my follow-up, i'm curious what you experienced in terms of any pushback from your customers to the price announcement.
i would assume not much just given how transparent higher dairy and freight costs are, and given how there's not much elasticity in the market right now. but i just wanted to get any color i could from you on that? thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
customers, as you guys know, customers never like a price increase, but they absolutely understand why we're doing it. as you explained, they're seeing the same inflation as we are. so they understand it. and remember, we took price two years ago and everyone behaved very rationally.
,customers reflected it. at-shelf elasticities were very close to our estimates, and so we expect the same this time.
operator
your next question comes from the line of andrew lazar of barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
hi. first off, i guess, with regard to premier. i know price/mix was down about 4.5% as a result of some of the incremental promotional activity. i mean that as you mentioned was -- was part of the pressure on gross margins.
i guess, could you discuss a little bit how you evaluate the trade-offs between incremental revenue generated versus the margin pressure? and i guess more of the optics right of what -- some might call perhaps lower-quality growth or a reliance on promotion. and i guess put another way what gives you the confidence that the incremental promotional spend is and continues to be an effective use of funds?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so our focus as we have walked you guys through is building household penetration. we continue to believe that that is the biggest driver of long-term value and growth for specifically premier protein. we knew we were going to -- one of the strategies to increase household pen is raising marketing and promotion this year to drive that. we know that once we get trial on this brand because of our repeat rates that are over 50%, we will have a loyal consumer.
so as we -- if you look at 2021 promos they are actually very similar to '20 except for we tested an incremental club promotion in q1 which is what you're seeing in the numbers. but other than that they're actually fairly consistent with some -- as you guys know we have our bigger push in q2 and q4 and then we added the q1 promotion as well.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. ok. thank you for that. and then, paul, you mentioned heading into the first quarter it was expected that pretty much all of the ebitda growth in fiscal 2021 would occur in the second half.
and obviously you had 3.5% growth that you realized in ebitda in the first quarter. and obviously fiscal 2q is anticipated to be down to off -- i guess is 2q anticipated to be down to basically offset this so that you still kind of have that same cadence of virtually all the ebitda growth in the second half? and then similarly on sales i mean it was expected sales in the first half will be up high single digit. obviously, first quarter was up far greater than that. if it was to hold to the first half guidance that you initially gave on sales, that would imply a deceleration in sales to maybe minus one to plus three in the second quarter.
but given you have so much momentum i don't know if that still holds. so anyway, i'm just trying to put this in perspective, what you did in the first quarter based on what your initial sort of first-half guidance was if you get my drift?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think i do. so our thinking on first-half growth is still -- is still in line with our original expectation. i think darcy touched on in her prepared remarks that we did see a little bit of a shift into q1 versus q2. so we just -- whenever you're loading these large promotions, sometimes they load a bit differently than you expect.
so what we believe we've seen is a bit of a pull in q1 a little harder than expected. so that obviously falls out in q2. and then with the freight headwinds obviously that puts some additional pressure on our second quarter as well. so we really think our -- our first half is largely intact.
there's just a little bit of a shift between the first and second quarter. no -- no concerns about the sequential revenue top line.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
ok. thanks so much to you both.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of brian holland of d.a. davidson.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning. so i wanted to probe that -- this implied q2 growth a little bit further. it sounds like i guess that some of that pull-in from q2 is maybe related to that club promotion that you referenced.
but i'm just curious if there's anything -- i mean obviously, there's something at the end of the quarter here when we start to lap the initial demand surge around covid. i mean is that just something where you feel like you don't have enough visibility on, so why not just stick with the same cadence through the first half and stay on that lapse? because -- or is there something else in one of these channels that we need to be mindful of? because again, you're accelerating in scanner through january that ran concurrent with the promotion at costco, so no cannibalization there. so it seems like a lot of momentum going into that second half of march. so anything that we should be mindful of other than just -- maybe just trying to be mindful of the covid comp?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
certainly, as we're lapping last year -- yeah, the covid comp was a big tailwind for us in the second quarter of last year. i think we previously estimated that the high single digit. it drove high single-digit growth for us last year that we're obviously lapping. so that does obviously weigh on your growth rates from last year to this year.
regarding the business momentum we do feel like it's still strong. there's nothing that i've seen or we've seen that would suggest that there's any reasons for concern. but everything we've seen from a revenue side has been tracking to our expectation again with just a bit of a shift from q1 into q2.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i'm sorry, paul just to -- yeah, paul just to confirm that, you said high single-digit contribution from, sort of, the covid demand surge in q2, that's how much that contributed?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
that's what it contributed to last year so that would be the headwind for this year. so that's the flip between q2 and q3 where it's a headwind in q2 and a tailwind for q3.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
understood. and then if i could just ask a big picture question. i think relative to three months, six months ago, it feels like we'll be in something similar to the dynamic that's in place today as it pertains to consumer mobility, which obviously has been beneficial to the category in your business in particular. but if we extrapolate that out further there's forecast out there that would suggest two times the american workforce will be working from home in some form five years from now versus pre-covid.
so darcy, i'm just wondering if you have done any work on that, any analysis and if there's reason to kind of rethink the opportunity here just given the relative convenience of shakes versus bars at home and obviously when we look at the penetration growth and the repeat rates on your business in particular. i'm just curious if you have any point on that.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we're incredibly excited about our momentum as a business. because not only, yes, we have the negative of the mobility, but we have the positive of i mean, we -- i walked through the category and liquids and powders are -- in the last 13 weeks are double the growth of the overall category. so we're seeing the tailwinds of just general health.
and the sentiment of consumers of really being worried about their general health and what they can do personally to improve that. so we've got that tailwind. and i think that's long-term, i think -- and i think obviously it got accelerated with the pandemic. but i think that will stay front and center for a while.
and so then you take that and then you put -- you layer on top the increase of mobility and that we are a convenience product, i think, we look forward and see a lot of encouraging signs.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
appreciate the color. best of luck.

your next question comes from the line of chris growe of stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning. i just had a question for you if i could. first on just to understand -- maybe i can better understand the fact that this quarter had a promotional load-in. and as i look at the charts and the data, i guess, i was still -- a little stump still on how with consumption being up so strongly for premier of 27.5%, and obviously, revenues and volume for that business being up less than that just how that dynamic worked.
and maybe more importantly, how much should come out of q2 as a result of that load-in that occurred in the first quarter?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'll take the latter part of your question there. so our thinking is that we've seen maybe a 1% to 2% pull forward q1 -- from q2 into q1. so it's not big, but it does impact obviously the growth rates a bit.
so that would be that part of your question. yes. i mean, our first quarter is typically a very heavy shipments to consumption quarter because all of the january promotions that are going on a lot of them do load for us in the first quarter. so -- and there's a chart in our supplemental that obviously, shows that dynamic.
and it's fairly consistent with last year. it was up a bit maybe from last year which is part of that pull forward that we're talking about, but it's not meaningfully different from last year's pull-in.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think what i would add is that, in on-track we did see the -- we had some ship-in volume in q4 that we saw the consumption in q1 which is i think -- which is the delta between the consumption and the shipments as well.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and to follow up on that, but i -- i understand what you're saying. just a quick second question would be just to get a sense of how much the inflation outlook has changed for the year.
and then can you give any color around the degree of the price increase you're taking? and maybe that will help dimensionalize the increase in cost?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
darcy, let me take the inflation piece and then you can --
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. from an inflation perspective, the change from our original estimate which is primarily freight is that it will be a 75 to 100-basis-point drag on the year. so that's the magnitude of the freight impact which has ramped up really kind of late in our first quarter.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
and then from a pricing standpoint just for competitive reasons, i don't think we're going to -- i'm not going to go into the exact price increase but it's modest and similar to what we took two years ago.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then just to be clear on that, paul, that inflation that 75 to 100-basis-point drag on the gross margins is that the way that you were quantifying that?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
that is exactly right.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks so much for your time.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tim perz of stephens inc.
tim perz -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning. congrats on the nice quarter.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
tim perz -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so how should we expect you to approach marketing spend this year? i know you plan to advertise on tv for an additional three months this year. but if you achieve your household penetrations kind of like ahead of time, would you be more inclined to drive margins by pulling back on marketing spend in the back half? or do you kind of plan to stick to that goal and pursue additional households this year?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we plan to continue with our plan from an advertising standpoint. big picture is we are under -- we believe we are underpenetrated. and so we know our marketing is working.
we're seeing early results. first of all, it worked last year to drive household penetration. we made some changes just to optimize it this year. and in early first three weeks, we see that it is more effective than even last year.
so we believe it is the right way to build long-term value for the business and we think there's a lot of upside. so we're absolutely continuing on the path to spend to acquiring household.
tim perz -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you. and premier protein household penetration was up about 18% year-over-year but your consumption exceeded that. so can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing from the buying rate among existing consumers and what's driving that higher?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so about 80 -- let's see if i'm going to get to your question. about 80% of our growth is coming from outside the category and it's a combination of new households and buy rate. two of our -- from a strategy standpoint our goal this year was twofold: household penetration and buy rate.
and so from a household penetration standpoint, we are increasing our marketing and our promotion as well as -- and then from a buy rate and coming out with new products, new flavors, et cetera. and then from a buy rate standpoint, we have our upsize initiative. so those combination is where you're seeing kind of -- you see the increase of household pen but then you see the buy rate as well.
tim perz -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thank you. i'll pass it on.

your next question comes from the line of bill chappell of truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
i just want to go back to just the freight issue. i'm just trying to understanding -- i imagine you have some freight contracts where you don't see the immediate hit as freight costs rise. and so i guess trying to understand since it is -- just as you said it crept up late in the first quarter and immediately hitting in the second quarter, what ways to prevent that from as they -- if they creep up again in the second quarter that you haven't priced enough for that as we go into the third quarter? just trying to understand kind of what visibility you have on your freight rates? and what kind of -- in order to price -- this doesn't happen again and again as we move through the year and things start to open up?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. we do have obviously some visibility into our freight costs through our providers. but it really did move up quite a bit.
and i think you've seen that obviously inflation with other companies as well with covid causing some shortages with drivers. but the really long-term thinking is that that will continue on for a period of time. but to your point, there obviously is always risk that it goes up and there's opportunities should it come down. but we feel like we've looked at the rest of the year and looked at it at this elevated level as we thought about the impact to our business for the rest of the year.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
so, i mean just your thought is, freight rates have peaked? or you priced for the potential peak? is that fair?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
the expectation, yes.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and then just a follow-up, just any color on channels? i mean is it safe to say, club versus non-club performed at a similar rate? or i mean, it did seem like you had more promotions? and obviously more new product introductions in the club channel. any color there would be helpful. thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, oh, sorry.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
no. go ahead. i was just going to clarify, if he meant premier or total bellring or both.bill chappellyes. i meant, premier, sorry.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so premier, on track, still for the quarter, overall our consumption was up 27.5%. it was led by untracked. so untracked still was tracking ahead and driving the growth over track, so up about 43%.
and track being up 15%. and it was -- we're having really -- we continue to have really solid growth in ecommerce. we did have a promotion in ecommerce, which drove some of that, which again was expected. and then, we're seeing solid growth in untracked club.
and then, -- but, i will say, i think some of the areas that, i'm most excited about is, our progress are in food -- specifically food and mass and getting more products on the shelf and really getting that brand block, which is something that we haven't had before. and we're seeing it in market.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jason english of goldman sachs.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, folks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jason.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
i guess i've got two quick questions. well, maybe not quick, but the first one is. how much of the growth in dymatize is coming from these pebbles extensions? and should we really look at these as almost like a license, in and out? or do you think there's reason to believe that could actually have durability?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so i don't have the exact number for pebbles but what -- but i'll separate out the growth -- the domestic growth from a distribution and velocity standpoint. so, about 60% of the growth was coming from distribution and about 40% from velocity. a lot of that velocity is coming from pebbles and the excitement there. so -- and it's really coming across channels.
we absolutely think it has durability. and i think that you'll start seeing -- i think the excitement around -- i think, i've explained the consumer insight to this piece. it's not just about borrowed equity. there -- it is steeped in solid consumer insight that basically says that, the dymatize consumer is, starved of carbs.
and so basically hasn't eaten sugary cereals but in a long time and love it. and so, because our product delivers so well on the fruity and cocoa pebble experience, it really is kind of scratching that itch. and so, that is a consumer insight that can be really built upon.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
interesting. second question, you've got a great organic growth story here. and i'm not asking you to muddy the waters. but i do recall when you guys were initially spinning out and standing this business up on a stand-alone basis, part of the rationale was to be able to have a high multiple business that could acquire other high-multiple businesses on the growth assets.
where is m&a on your agenda today? and have you seen any opportunities, perhaps open up during covid?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you highlighted and described it well. we do believe. and we've communicated this, that we are excited.
the organic growth of specifically premier, but also dymatize is our number one priority. and we still think there's a ton of upside. and that really is our focus. and just to jump, we've -- historically we've talked more about premier, as being the driver of that, which it will be.
but i think the recent momentum on dymatize really gets us excited about that growth story as well. and so, that puts us in a situation where m&a is absolutely one of our growth strategy. but it becomes more of a nice to have, as opposed to a need to have, which allows us to pick and choose and wait for the right opportunity as opposed to being forced to buy something, because we're trying to hold up a growth rate.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thanks a lot. i'll pass it on.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

your next question comes from the line of rob dickerson of jefferies.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. great. thank you so much. darcy yesterday a larger food company who doesn't really focus specifically on protein shakes bars powders stated that seemed like your discussions with retailers and kind of what they've seen on the shelf, let's say, in the past six months would suggest that maybe there's been a little bit more shelf allocated to kind of shakes and powders, right? just given kind of the adult consumption shift, maybe there's a less attraction for the time being, at least, just to the more on-the-go bars.
and then they stated, though, that also through those conversations with the retailers that they would think that some of that would reverse back out, right? so maybe there's almost a bit temporary mix adjustment, obviously, to cater to where demand is. so i just thought i'd ask, kind of, if that's what you're seeing too, if you agree with that, kind of, what your perspective is. and really would there be so much shift? because it seems like your shift has been driven by good product and distribution gain, increased gdps not off a covid, kind of, was already planned. but then there's kind of the other commentary that it's the overlay of kind of what's happening within the broader category, if we think about the mix between powders and shakes, vis-a-vis, bars, if that makes sense.
thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it does make sense. i agree with the fact that we're seeing some shift of shelf space from bars to rtds and powders. i have not heard that, that is a temporary change. i guess i look at it as, retailers keep -- i mean, very simply retailers keep items that are growing and are growing their category.
and so, as i've just said, 80% of our growth is coming from outside of the category. we actually have very little growth that is coming from shifting among the category. so -- and we're one of the highest velocity products in the category. so i haven't heard it.
and honestly i -- it doesn't worry me from a premier standpoint or a dymatize standpoint, for that matter.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, great. and then, i guess, just as quickly, obviously, the focus right now is building the core, right? there's a long runway of growth still on the current product offerings or categories as you just stated. there's the new premier cereal, right? just, we've seen the innovation already come out. we've discussed earlier on the post-call.
are you thinking already kind of like where can we take premier, right? let's -- we have kind of the plan in place in terms of the distribution strategy and with the right offerings we just need to execute. so maybe there's a little bit more bandwidth in terms of kind of where you could take the category into other adjacent -- sorry, other adjacencies. or for now, is it just block and tackle on the core? thanks. that's it.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it's both. so, actually, the core we saw the kind of upside within our categories, but innovation is a big driver for us. we've been investing both within r&d as well as within marketing and focusing on where this brand can go. i think cereal was a good test for us.
we could see if the brand could travel outside to other categories and other heavily trafficked aisles. and i think the early results are really positive. and so, we look at that -- we've always thought that a growth -- future growth was -- we've talked about center of store. and i think that this bodes well for that transition.
now, it's just about what is the best strategy to go to center of store.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of ken zaslow of bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i have two questions. one is when you think about your shelf space gains, can you talk about how much shelf space you gained? and how much do you think that's permanent? and maybe that's my first question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, we -- i'm forgetting the exact numbers in my prepared remarks, but we gained substantial shelf space both on premier and on dymatize this last quarter. we're pretty consistently gaining tdps. tdps are that -- we communicated that we're undershelved really. our market share would -- from a kind of market share versus share of shelf, we are still undershelf.
so we still have room to grow. but this q1 was a really big move. we gained substantial -- i think, i mentioned this in the last call we doubled our shelf size in a mass retailer. coming up in the spring is the reset for some major food accounts.
we will continue to see big distribution expansions within those accounts, further expanding our brand block. so -- and then dymatize, we gained i think 38% tdps in fdm which is a big push for us. and that was mainly due to a mass account. and we're already seeing the velocities strong enough to hold that space and expand.
so, same thing on dymatize, where we see these food accounts, which we're going to -- we're expecting to see some increase in dymatize as well.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
my second question is when i think about expanding the premier brand, what consumer insight did you see that would want premier to get into the cereal category? a category, which i don't know if i could remember, but the possibility of success of a new brand in cereal can't be more than 1%, right? it's a very low -- what consumer insights do you have that would give you the confidence that extending premier into cereal versus i don't know, other categories would be the right foray for you to get into the center of the store? just a thought there. thanks,
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
well, the first thing is that we know that premier, as a brand is consumed 60% of the time at breakfast. so, we also know that breakfast is an occasion, where consumers don't usually get enough protein. they have bagels and donuts and muffins. so -- and we know, as the old saying goes, it's the most important meal of the day.
so, that is i think the insights. now, the second piece is, just a practical application, which i would just say is, we also happen to have a sister company who makes cereal. so, it was a fairly easy test to see if our brand could travel. so, i think there is very much steep and solid consumer insights, but also there's a practical element.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you, very much.

your next question comes from the line of kaumil gajrawala of credit suisse.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. good morning or i guess good afternoon. can you talk a little bit about ecommerce, ecommerce capabilities, and maybe a bit about how much it grew, but also just how it's evolving? what sort of capital you might be putting in or investments you're making to expand that side of your business?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ecommerce is a big focus for us. so, just to give you a sense of kind of history and where we are. in 2019, ecommerce represented 6% of our business. it now is at 10% of our business.
we think that it could be 10% to 15%. so, we've invested -- also what's interesting about ecommerce, what we've learned is it is a great trial driver for us. so we're actually seeing the -- our household penetration grow in trial through ecommerce, and then sometimes actually then buy -- because our ecommerce product is a little bit more expensive than in other channels, oftentimes, we'll see consumers enter in an ecommerce and then repeat in other channels. and just from a capability standpoint, we are expanding marketing dollars.
we're actually looking at pursuing ecommerce-only innovation. we've increased headcount. and we have a general management, kind of, approach to ecommerce where we have kind of sales, marketing and operations working together because it is a different way to go to market.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
interesting. thank you. and then on the topic of -- the primary mission has been about increasing household penetration, and your successes of course now being replicated to the best of their ability by others. but we're also going into a time where pricing is necessary maybe promotion mitigation is necessary while competition is also increasing.
so how are you thinking about just the dynamic between those two? is it a little bit of a -- are we in the growth curve of the industry where it's a bit of a real estate grab? or is this something that you feel like it's ok to call the gist for a period of time, and deal with the input costs and worry about some of this other stuff later?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
well, so last -- it's a great question. so last quarter i -- we came out and said that we would rather not take price. we wanted to drive top line. we felt like we would -- we were comfortable with the assumptions, the cost inflation assumptions that we had incorporated in our forecast to not take price.
however, we also said that if those assumptions prove to be too low, and the facts come up and they are higher than that, we would adjust our course. and that's what happened. freight is, obviously, increasing as well as we saw some increase of dairy proteins. so we decided to take price at the back half.
we evaluated other areas like marketing et cetera. we just felt like given our household penetration and given our experience and our long-term goals of talking to more consumers and our marketing is working we didn't want to pull that back. so i still believe that even though we're taking price, we still will increase household penetration. and we're going to be watching that closely.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of john baumgartner of wells fargo.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
maybe first off, darcy. back on the promotion front for premier, in terms of total activity for 2021, how are you balancing the degree of activity between straight price discounts for consumers relative to investments for in-store displays, or any push levers for the trade? and how does that balance differ relative to the past few years as the brand now grows penetration?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so our philosophy -- and not really -- i wouldn't -- maybe it's not our philosophy. so from a promotion standpoint, a few years ago we used to only get tprs from a trade perspective. now because we have tested -- our brand is big enough. we've proved the retailers that actually we bring in more households when we're on display and we have quality merch.
we are only doing quality merch. so -- and that has made all the difference in the world from an effectiveness standpoint. so we -- once -- hopefully you guys have seen this, but in the new year new you, i mean, we had displays in most retailers and large displays, sometimes multiproduct displays. and so -- and that is really important for us because we bring so many people from outside the category, and that we need to get out of the aisle to get people's eyeballs.
and then once we do, we hold them, we get the repeat and we grow the category for the long-term. so i think that -- let me see if i answered your question about promotion and the split.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes, absolutely right on point there. and then, i guess a follow-up just to come back to dymatize, given that your comments this morning seem, i guess, pretty bullish as the new iso products go from drawing board into the market. when you think about premier exponentially surprising to the upside from the time it was acquired i guess back in 2013, how do you see the parallel evolving for dymatize? i mean just given what you're sort of learning real-time about the brand and consumers. is there any reason why it couldn't evolve into a $500 million business over time? i mean are the ambitions sort of changing or growing to any extent there? thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we are very pleased with the momentum of dymatize. i think what is encouraging is how it is taking in the mass. not that long ago, this brand was a specialty-only product.
and so, to have -- and the team has done a fantastic job of repositioning it and changing and moving the channels to make it much more balanced. it's succeeding in ecommerce and again now mass. if i fast forward five years, i still believe premier is going to be our big brand. i expect us to have more brands than just premier and dymatize.
but premier will be the biggest brand just because it is the most mainstream brand. and i've talked about how we actually kind of source volume or appeal to all of the different consumers. but dymatize has a very solid place right for athletes in sports nutrition. it has a very clear consumer.
and so, yes, i believe that it can be a much bigger brand, double the size that it is now eventually.
john baumgartner -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
well, i'm trying to spread the word out of gold's gym. so trying to do my part, for what it's worth. thank you for your time.

your next question comes from the line of david palmer of evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. the question -- just a bit of a follow-up to rob's question about retailers giving more merchandising and shelf at the expense of bars, and obviously that's a retailer decision. i guess there's consumer ones behind that.
and i guess there is a thought that this is a convenience play that bars are on-the-go-type products and maybe the shakes are not as much and this is a temporary thing. and as mobility returns it gets better for bars. that could be one narrative. but i suspect that's simplistic and there are other consumer needs demands that are at play here, that -- because ready-to-drink beverage is pretty convenient too.
so, could you just talk about that what you're seeing in terms of the interplay? and is it really one cannibalizing the other in your view?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
they really have different occasions. so i mean, if you think of -- shakes are for the most part 60% consumed in the morning. they're more likely to be used as a meal -- a healthy meal replacement. bars are much more snacking-oriented and they're much more on-the-go.
i think what -- there are a lot of consumer trends and macro trends that are fueling the rtd and the liquid side of things as well as the powder side of things that are tailwinds to bars, but not quite as much. and those are all around general health immunity. if you think of -- so most rtds have a vitamin and mineral blend, those are very important to consumers. and so that -- when you're talking about people are trying to increase their immunity, et cetera, that becomes the work.
as we go more into kind of proactive health those naturally fall within rtds. and i think you're going to start seeing a bigger divide between rtds and powders and bars which have made their way much more into snacking.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thank you. and just a question on marketing and the message both how you market and what messages you're going to play on. and i'm wondering about the buzz creation type of stuff and how much of it is what you're trying to do in social media.
i wonder for example did you have something to do with the users combining premier protein with starbucks coffee, so that protein/coffee buzz that we saw out there over the last quarter or so? and what you're doing from a digital messaging standpoint the things you're pushing on from a message standpoint? thanks.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we love the proffee. so what is -- so i don't know exciting about premier is our consumers create the content. we don't ask them to.
they just do it because there is so much excitement and love for this brand. what we do is once they create it we fuel it. and we then kind of jump on it and give it more legs. changes to strategies from an advertising standpoint, it's more tweaking than anything else.
we have tv, we have digital and social media. we are adding more dollars and more time to the budget. we're talking to more people. so we are adding consumers with different types of messages.
the beauty of obviously digital and social is that you can change the message slightly depending on who the audience is. we updated creative. i said this in my prepared remarks is, it's all been about our devoted fans really telling other people authentically why they consume the product. but now we're complementing those with what we're calling -- we call the first one's testimonials.
we call that second one's testimonials, which is really all about taste and hitting that how amazing our consumers believe the taste is and showing it in visuals. and then we're also supporting some of our new products with national media, which we've never done before. so those are some of the changes within our strategy and kind of how we amplify the buzz that already happened from our consumers.

bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning. just two quick ones for me. one is, i know you talked a lot about kind of where the first quarter landed versus expectations and cadence for the year.
but i think i might have missed or i'm not sure if i might have missed this. but just where is consumption tracked relative to what your expectations were and especially around premier and given just the elevation and activity you've had -- merchandising activity you've had? has that run ahead of what your expectations were?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
consumption is pretty consistent with our expectation. i would say with one small change is we did -- and i think i mentioned this, maybe in some of the follow-up to the last quarter is, we did see a small increase in november in some club stores when some of the additional lockdowns happened in several of the states almost like a mini-panic buy. what was interesting about it is, it appears to not -- people bought more, but yet -- but then they consumed more in the quarter. so it didn't affect our -- it didn't -- we didn't see the decrease that we saw in last march.
so that was the only thing that was surprising from a consumption standpoint. it's just a little bit of a panic buy in november.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. thanks. and then just related to the price increase, should we factor in anything for customers maybe buying ahead of that price increase? so when it's effective -- so i guess trying to understand just whether or not there will be any other disconnects between shipments and consumption just consumption related to the price increase?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we don't -- that's going to happen. that will happen somewhat. we do monitor that.
and if people -- if retailers put in three times the orders than normal we will act on that and try to bring it down. so i wouldn't necessarily model in a massive increase. i think that we have control over that. we did not have that happen two years ago.
and so i think we have a process in place to address that.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
terrific. ok. thank you.

in addition, the release and slides are available on the sec's website. before we continue, i would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that should be carefully considered by investors as actual results could differ materially from these statements. these forward-looking statements are current as of the date of this call and management undertakes no obligation to update these statements. as a reminder, this call is being recorded and an audio replay will be available on our website.
and finally, this call will discuss certain non-gaap measures. for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the nearest gaap measure, see our press release issued yesterday and posted on our website. with that, i will turn the call over to darcy. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. last evening we reported our first-quarter results, as well as, posted a supplemental presentation to our website. the presentation provides more insight into our business, consumption, and key metrics. i'm pleased to report that our fiscal 2021 is off to a good start with net sales of $282 million and adjusted ebitda of $61 million, slightly above our internal estimates.
net sales were up 16% with premier protein and dymatize both growing double digits. as you saw in our press release, we affirmed our sales and adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year. the quarterly cadence is largely as expected with some minor tweaks. first, we slightly overperformed both sales and adjusted ebitda in the first quarter mainly due to a shift in sales from the second quarter.
second, inflation ramped up in the middle of the first quarter. we have done a good job with our cost-out strategy and have been able to offset a portion of these headwinds. but given the expected surge in freight and additional milk protein inflation, we announced a modest price increase in our shake business starting in q3. we will experience continued margin pressure in q2 until the price increase is implemented, but we are confident in our full-year guidance.
now turning to our category, brand highlights, and growth strategies. the overall convenient nutrition category remains stable. growth in liquids and powders accelerated this quarter and are running above pre-covid growth rates. the adult and everyday nutrition segments are driving this growth as consumers are increasingly focused on their general health.
most of the increased penetration is coming from everyday nutrition, while growth in adult is primarily the same consumers buying more. powders are also seeing some strong momentum resulting from increased at-home consumption. premier protein shake consumption grew meaningfully this quarter, up 28% across tracked and untracked channels. growth was broad-based and accelerated in nearly all channels when compared to prior quarter and a year ago.
healthy velocities, strong distribution gains and incremental promotions drove this growth. food and ecommerce channels led the way, up 69% and 121% respectively. this strong momentum has continued in q2 with our first four weeks showing 17% growth across tracked and untracked channels, with impressive gains in food, mass, and ecommerce. we continue to make great progress against our growth strategies.
premier protein's household penetration reached 7%, an increase of 19% over prior year. our distribution continues to build with brand tdps up 17% sequentially, reflecting our q1 shelf gain. in january, we kicked off our national marketing campaign, which includes tv, digital and social media. we complemented our proven strategy of having real fans explain why they love our shakes, with spots focused on our key differentiator: amazing taste.
in the first few weeks of the campaign, our results are encouraging, with search and website traffic exceeding the same period last year. our new flavors and pack sizes are driving significant growth. café latte, now in its second year; and cinnamon roll, our newest flavor are performing in the top 15% of the category were sold. our upsizing initiative is off to a great start with our new 12 count driving almost three quarters of our growth in the mass channel.
premier is also growing outside of shakes, with powders up 129% driven by distribution and velocity. dymatize had another strong quarter, up 35% domestically, with growth across all key channels. distribution in fdm grew 38% since prior quarter with strong product expansion in the mass channel. our new iso100 products, fruity and cocoa pebbles, continue to be standouts driving velocity across all channels and securing significant new distribution.
our international sales were flat year over year. premier shakes in canada showed meaningful increases, but softness across the rest of the portfolio offset this growth. the impact of covid on the global specialty channel continues to affect the dymatize and powerbar brands. however, we expect this to slowly recover later this year.
i want to take a moment to discuss the business realignment we executed this quarter, which impacts both dymatize and our international business. over the last several years, there has become more overlap between premier protein and dymatize in the us. as a result, we decided to combine the management of these two brands housed in emeryville. as part of the realignment, we created a dedicated international team, who will drive growth across all of our brands outside the us.
regrettably, these changes result in reductions across our workforce in dallas and germany. i believe this was a needed strategic step to position bellring for the future, but these decisions are not made lightly, and i want to thank our employees for all the hard work and dedication over the past years. overall, i remain confident in our 2021 outlook. our supply chain performance is strong and our shake co-man network is well positioned to support our growth.
our new creative is now running and our messaging is reaching more households. our distribution gains are driving meaningful growth, and we are seeing strong brand blocks across most major retailers. our new products are succeeding in market and our innovation pipeline is building, driving long-term value for the brand. i continue to be energized by our long runway for growth and now believe we have optimized our organizational structure to truly drive those growth strategies.
i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. net sales for the quarter were $282.4 million, up 15.7%. adjusted ebitda was $60.7 million, up 3.6%, and ebitda margin was 21.5%. premier protein net sales increased 17.4%, driven by rtd shakes.
first-quarter results benefited from distribution gains for both existing and new products, and incremental promotional activity. dymatize net sales grew 16.2% this quarter driven by distribution gains in club and mass, and continued double-digit growth in ecommerce. international sales for dymatize improved sequentially, but remained weak on a year-over-year basis as a result of covid. net sales of all other products decreased 11.2%.
turning back to consolidated results. gross profit of $91.9 million increased 0.7% this quarter with gross profit margin declining 490 basis points to 32.5%. the margin decline was largely as expected and related to higher input costs, primarily milk-based proteins and freight as well as incremental promotional activity. sg&a expenses were $38.3 million and as a percentage of net sales declined 140 basis points to 13.6%.
sg&a expenses in the current year included $4.6 million of restructuring and facility closure costs related to our business realignment that darcy discussed earlier. these expenses were partially offset by $1.5 million of lower separation costs, both of which were treated as adjustments for non-gaap measures. excluding these items, sg&a was down approximately $1 million compared to prior year. and marketing spend was flat.
before reviewing our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on cash flow and liquidity. we had a strong first quarter for cash flow generating $23 million from operations. at quarter end, we had $50.8 million of cash on hand and $150 million available under our revolver. as of december 31, net debt was $635 million and net leverage was 3.2 times.
turning to our outlook. we continue to expect fiscal 2021 net sales of $1.07 billion to $1.12 billion and adjusted ebitda of $207 million to $217 million. as darcy previewed, our quarterly pacing is largely tracking with our expectations. however, first-half gross margins will be further pressured by higher freight costs before rebounding in the second half when our rtd shake pricing takes effect.
for the second quarter, recall that we will lap the prior-year covid pantry loading benefit for premier protein, which is a headwind to our net sales and ebitda growth, but a tailwind for our third quarter. in addition, our promotional activity and advertising investments will peak in q2 as expected. overall, we remain confident in our full-year estimates and are pleased with the top-line performance and distribution wins for premier protein and dymatize. with that, i would like to turn the call back over to the operator for your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] the first question will come from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
oh. hi, thank you. i just wanted to understand a little bit of the guidance. i thought you had been saying earlier that the pricing was largely offsetting the commodities and the freight inflation.
but then i thought i heard at the very end, you're saying that the inflation was higher than you thought, and it'll hurt your gross margin. so is the pricing higher as well? i just wanted to think about the balance of that as we model the gross margin out here.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. sure, ken. i'll take that. since our february call, inflation has increased more than we expected, primarily in the second half.
the second quarter was right on track from a margin perspective of what we expected. but the second half has increased, and it's inflation really across several fronts. it's not one thing that's individually significant, but they add up. we've seen some increase on whey proteins and our milk proteins as well, to a lesser degree, freight.
so our price increase is offsetting the inflation in the second half. it's just the inflation is a bit more than we anticipated last quarter. so that is weighing on our margins in the second half.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then i know there have been some concerns or just questions really about weight loss season, potentially coming in a bit lighter than in prior years. i understand it's not always easy to tell why a consumer is purchasing a product, but is it your understanding that weight loss went well? or did that season gets shifted a little bit into your third quarter? i just wanted to get a little bit of sense for how you're seeing that.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
our q2, you know what, we kind of term as new year, new you, which i think is what you're saying kind of weight loss season, we did really well. so in the category, it's really dependent on what form, and i think it was depressed by the on-the-go. so for instance, liquids and powders did very well, while bars did not do very well. and that was really because bars are more heavily weighted on the on-the-go occasion.
so overall, i think when you look at the category this last quarter in liquids and powders, every kind needs to be increased with the exception of weight. and so adult was up. sports nutrition was up. everyday nutrition was up, which is really the area that premier plays and dymatize in sports.
weight was down. and then when you look across the overall convenient nutrition category, both liquids and powders were up, and bars was down. so there's no doubt that the pandemic has added weight to people. i do think that it will come back.
but i think what drives the convenient nutrition category is much bigger than just weight management.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i understood very much. thank you.

the next question will come from the line of andrew lazar with barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
good morning everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
darcy, i think it's about 15 flavors now available. household penetration, right, reaching 7.4%, and obviously, the significant distribution gains you mentioned in some of the previously less-developed channels. i guess the question starts to shift a little bit toward how much run rate is sort of left in these things? and is there one of those particular drivers that is most important among those that are listed going forward? how do you think about that, the room that's left to go? i think i know your answer, but i want to get a sense of how you're thinking about it.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i think you probably know my answer. the upside is still immense. and we always look at household penetration being the biggest driver. and household penetration, yes, is at 7.4%.
the liquids category is at 24%. the overall convenient nutrition category is around 50%. so there's so much upside just in household penetration. and what's nice is the tactics that we are driving, so our advertising, the promotional activity, as well as just the distribution in new channels.
it is driving household penetration as we've seen by the rises. but from a distribution standpoint, you're right, we have launched a lot of new flavors. our flavor strategy and our upsizing initiative is absolutely working. but just to give you a sense of our space and the upside, so we have an average in tracked channels of about 7.5 items on shelf.
one of our competitors, which has about an equal market share as us, they have 13 items on the shelf. we have incredibly productive skus. and so even though our distribution is up 55% versus year ago, the upside potential is still very large.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for that. and then, paul, just a quick follow-up. in terms of visibility for the rest of this year in terms of your cost, in terms of what can be sort of locked in and do you have a pretty good handle on or what your maybe forward coverage might be for those things that you can cover? trying to get a sense of how much movement can now change or not with respect to your cost outlook, at least for this fiscal year.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. at this point in the year, we have a pretty good handle on the protein side. freight isn't quite as long, but again, for the most part, at this point in time, we feel pretty comfortable with our coverage and understanding of the margin structure in the second half.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thank you.

next question will come from the line of chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
i just had a question for you on the revenue growth guidance. you had a little beat of expectations in the second quarter, but obviously, your second half is going up pretty significantly. you're seeing a nice significant increase, it seems like in april. i just want to get a sense of as you think about that guidance, and you did talk about, i think, sequential improvements through the remainder of the year.
but how much of that incremental revenue growth expectation you have? is that 3q? or is it really kind of split across 3q and 4q? just trying to get a sense of that.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's split across 3q and 4q. so remember, q3 of 2020 had the pretty big trough following covid. so just to give you a sense, if our results were exactly the same sales as h1, that would already be a 16% increase.
and what we have on top of that is organic growth, more distribution, we have incremental promotion in the second half and some incremental advertising. so hopefully it gets you comfortable with our build of why we're seeing a 24% to 30% growth in the back half.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's helpful. yes. and i had one other question, i think for paul, but it's a bit of a follow-on to the inflation question. so could you characterize the rate of inflation in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year? i know the first half had quite a bit of inflation.
is the second half kind of caught up to where the first half is? i realize you have pricing coming through. i'm just trying to get a sense of how that shifts from first half to second half.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. the second half, based on our revised guidance, we're expecting higher both milk and whey protein cost in the second half versus the first half. and so it is up year over year more than we anticipated previously. on the milk side, it's relatively small on a percentage basis, low single-digit inflation.
so it's not a major change. on whey proteins, which is the primary ingredient in our powders, we're seeing much more significant increases on those that aren't really as impactful for us this year. we do expect some impact on our fourth quarter. it's more for as we get into fiscal '22, the inflation on our whey powder business is a concern.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so you it seems like the second half rate of inflation below that of the first half. would that be a fair characterization, and again, realizing you have some pricing coming through?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. the rate of inflation, you're correct, is at a lower rate, but it's still a headwind.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. sure. ok. thanks so much for that.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from the line of david palmer with evercore isi.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just wanted to get a sense of the level of -- and perhaps the year-over-year increase in marketing and promotion spending the quarter and sort of how you see that playing out through the year. what i'm thinking about is you had big plans in 2020, and covid happened.
so i'm wondering if there's some leftover business and perhaps even some pivoting that you're making about how you think the consumer will be behaving coming out of covid. so any color there would be helpful.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, go ahead.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
i can take the numbers and then if you want to give the qualitative. so you'd asked second quarter marketing was up about $2 million versus last year. our first half marketing spend was around 4% of net sales. as we look at the second half, we expect to continue to invest as a percent of net sales in a similar high three's to 4% range as we're really seeing the marketing be effective.
and then i'll turn over to darcy for additional color.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
and yes, just from a strategy and a pivoting standpoint, the advertising is working. i think the slight change of strategy that we made this year versus last year is i think i've talked to you guys about our testimonials, which we've long used our devoted fans to tell other consumers why they love the product. we will continue to use that. what we have augmented it with is what we call tastemonial, which is really focusing on one of the things that really differentiates the premier protein brand, which is amazing taste.
and we have added commercial both digital and analog about the flavors. so we have one on cafe latte. we have one on caramel, and they're really performing. so we actually are seeing the velocities on both of those flavors far exceed the rest of the line.
so that has been a very positive move. it really has nothing to do with covid. it has more to do with just what we are getting better and better at knowing what drives our business.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
just a comment, and maybe you can comment on the comment. it seems like you almost let the functionality of your product and how consumers use your product, whether it's about immunity or meal replacement protein seeking or the weight management aspects of that, you'll let that not be part of your message almost on purpose. is that how you're playing it? and to your point, do you think the net effect of those need states will be positive going forward, i.e. the immunity dropping off will be more than outweighed by people looking for weight management in the future.
how are you thinking about that?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
you're absolutely right. what is unique about premier is that it appeals to so many different occasions, so many different need states. so we allow consumers to fit it into their life. i mean, if you look at our campaign, too good to be good, there is no prescription as to how they should use it.
so absolutely, you nailed it. on the second question, we're putting an immunity claim. we changed our product, and that comes out later this summer. we still think health and wellness, immunity, this is going to be a trend.
we don't think even after people are completely vaccinated, we still think it is top of mind, and it will continue to drive this category. so we don't think that's going away. what i think will happen is that it's going to be the people leaning into weight, it's just going to be additive.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.

the next question will come from the line of pamela kaufman with morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
can you comment on the split between the change in outlook for gross margin versus your operating expenses and driving the change in your ebitda margin outlook for the year? obviously, it seems like you're facing more inflation than originally expected, but you also mentioned incremental marketing spend. so how should we think about the mix of the two driving your lower-margin outlook?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. our lower-margin outlook is primarily being driven by lower expectations on our gross margins because of the inflationary pressures on our key proteins and freight. we are spending a bit more on brand investments, but it's not as much of an impact to our overall margins. we're largely spending in line with our sales growth.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then can you talk about how you expect to see your customer mix evolve over the coming quarters as you expand distribution in fdm? does this have any implications on your margin profile as well? and what impact are you seeing in the club channel as you expand into fdm?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
paul, you can add to this. overall, our margins are pretty similar across our different businesses. so that really isn't a factor. fdm's a little higher, but nothing dramatic.
from our customer mix, clearly, we have a large club business. i think that as we expand into fdm, our growth in ecommerce, food and drug and mass is higher. and so that split will change. however, what's interesting, and i think i've talked to you guys before about this is all of this works together.
so these other new channels, we have different sizes, but there are smaller pack sizes that are launched in these channels. and so people are trying the product and being introduced to the product in food, drug, mass and ecommerce. and then often, they are then repeating in club. so really the kind of virtuous cycle work, one being more trial and then it feeds into the club channel.
so overall, the pie just gets bigger.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you. that's helpful.

the next question will come from the line of bill chappell with truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just two kind of more follow-up questions. one, i'm right in saying that most of the pricing you're taking is list pricing, there's no real change your promotional calendar for the back half.
is that correct?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
correct, yes. and going into the year, our promotional calendar was skewed toward the second half and specifically in the fourth quarter, and that's unchanged.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got you. so covering the incremental costs are just through the list price increase. not any alterations there.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
correct. and that's on our shake business, correct.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got you. and then second, just maybe on a follow-up on the channels. now that i think most of the planograms are reset, what kind of year was this in terms of shelf space gains, especially at fdm? but in general, how does that compare versus last year? and how does that set you up kind of going forward?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
we gained more shelf space this year than last year. so we're up 55% in shelf space in tracked channel, so significant change. i think what's exciting is we are seeing some customers pushing a four-foot set, and where we have that four-foot set within fdm, we're seeing tremendous market share gains, which is a little bit obvious. and what's also happening is it's great for the category.
so we're able to sell across fdm and to our customers to really encourage them to expand the space because it will grow their category.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. well, it's fantastic. thanks so much.

the next question will come from the line of kaumil gajrawala with credit suisse.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey everybody. good morning. the first question, darcy, you opened with category growth is accelerating. you expect it to continue to accelerate.
is this kind of acceleration or growth kind of according to plan? or are you seeing something perhaps different from what your view might have been about the category a few years ago? we are hearing from a few other companies kind of demand rebounding a bit more quickly than anticipated. so is this kind of a year-over-year comp thing? or is it something structurally seem to have shifted [inaudible]?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
we are seeing category growth slightly above historic rates. we've historically seen the liquids category specifically growth of about 5%. we are seeing it between 6% and 7%. so definitely higher than the past and slightly higher than our expectations, too.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. and then any color or commentary on the price elasticity? obviously, given input costs, you need to take pricing once again. can you just talk about what you've seen in the past, what you're planning for? just go around to give us a sense.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so when we talked about this that we took price in '19, and the in-market elasticities were very similar to what we projected. so in our pricing increase this time is pretty similar to what we experienced or what we took in '19. so we're expecting the same.
i think that the upside here is that it assumes no other competitors take price. and given the far-reaching inflation affecting everyone, especially in proteins and freight, we do expect competitors to follow. if that's the case, then obviously, our outlook will be conservative.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

next question will come from the line of rob dickerson with jefferies.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks so much darcy, i heard you earlier comment that the innovation pipeline remains robust. so i just want to dig into that a little bit. obviously, the mix of the business increasingly is going to shakes.
shakes are doing well. you're obviously highlighting shakes, right? it seems as if kind of the bar business is just kind of gradually not as much of a focus, let's say. so, one, i don't know if that's correct; and then, two, just when you think about innovation, are you speaking kind of more to other variations of the shakes, be it flavors, what have you? or bigger picture, the distribution works well and velocities work well in certain products and categories with the brand that you might extend or you could extend into other areas?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our focus is definitely on beverages, so both ready-to-drink and powders. we have pulled away from bars, at least domestically. we still have a pretty strong bar business in the eu.
so we'll continue that. but on the bulk of our business, you're exactly right. we're focused on beverages. yes, our innovation pipeline, i am incredibly excited about.
we have really leaned into this area organizationally, and i think it's really paying off. so we've hired a new lead, what we call vp of growth. we've added to our insights team. we've expanded our r&d team really to focus on ready-to-drink and powders, but really focusing on ready-to-drink beverages because they are very complicated to develop.
and when you look at the pipeline, we still have a few new products that are coming out later this year. i talked about the immunity claim, but also this idea of expanding flavor. it is working. it's working from a household penetration and a buy rate standpoint.
so we're going to continue that. i kind of put the pipeline. it's about flavor and function. and we'll continue to bring news and excitement around flavor on both of our brands.
but then we will also really elevate the function. and i think what i'm excited about is we're exploring new benefit areas. we're really encouraged by the results of cafe latte when we added the benefit of caffeine. it opened up new occasions to what has predominantly been a breakfast occasion.
now we're seeing people drinking shakes in kind of that late afternoon. and so leveraging that success, we're already thinking about other benefit areas that are potentially new to the category. but it will be likely in the beverage category. so it will be either ready-to-drink or powder.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, super. and then second question is just on the distribution game plan, you had example earlier of a competitor in the space that has excellent skus, and you have fewer skus, right? so if you're, let's say, bringing that new innovation to market and you look at the current retailers you're in now, would you say that kind of the closer end push on potential distribution gain as we think for, call it, or through '21 is more about getting the incremental shelf space for existing customers a bit more so than pushing into new customers and getting new distribution from there? so really just a new customer versus tdps within preexisting customers? that's it. thanks so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes, correct. we see the bigger opportunity. the bigger, immediate opportunity is just more space in our existing customers. however, new channels is definitely a growth area.
we've talked about recently, in the last year, we entered into the dollar channel. well, it's doing very well, and again, it's a great trial channel. we've talked about out-of-home kind of like the convenience and food service channels, which we really haven't gone there yet, and that's a big opportunity. so i would say the biggest immediate opportunity is definitely more space where we already are, but then we're already laying the groundwork for the new channels as well.all right.
great. thanks darcy.

next question comes from the line of ken zaslow with bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
can you talk about how your business case for dymatize has changed? it seems like there's seemingly more opportunity there than maybe you initially thought years back just kind of parallel next to your initial comments back in the separation?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our strategy on dymatize is around expanding the brand to mass channels is definitely working. our focus around iso100 as a flagship product line and really rallying all of the dedicated media around that line is also working. i think flavor excitement around these licenses, again, is bringing kind of new life.
but i think, again, we figured out the recipe that works. i think the old dymatize of only being sold in the specialty channel was just too limited. the consumer is everywhere, and they shop across channels. so expanding it.
the specialty channel is still very important to us and will continue to be. but we think there's a ton of opportunities that ecommerce is doing incredibly well, and then there's a lot of growth within that.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
with that, as well as the performance in premier, do you think that your 10% to 12% long-term growth algorithm is more of a floor than an actual algorithm going forward? it just seems like that 10% to 12% is seemingly more of a floor than anything else, given the change between the dymatize business in the shelf space and the momentum there. and then i'll leave it there.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think it's a floor. i still think it's a good long-term algorithm. we're still a new public company, and so we will continue to evaluate if that is the right algorithm. there's been a lot of noise since we went public, as you guys know.
but it has held. and this year, obviously, we're exceeding it. we will continue to look and assess given our brand portfolio if it still move forward. and if we see that there's upside, we'll update it.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

hey. good morning folks. thanks for the question. appreciate it.
and congrats on another good quarter. i guess i'm going to play the other side of that question of what the right durable growth rate is for the business. it sounds like a lot of your growth right now is coming from distribution expansion. and if we look at one channel where you've been present for a long time, the club channel, your business has slowed a lot.
we're down into low single-digit type growth. so can you give us, for us a sense of what's happening in the club channel? and then to play devil's advocate, should we look at that as sort of the reference point of what sustainable growth is when the distribution tailwinds subside?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's a great question. so this quarter, you're absolutely right, club channel was low single digits. but it really is more of a factor about what it's lapping.
so last year, the covid stock-up really affected club. it affected it early and more than the other channels. so we're lapping it. if you actually look at april, our business is up 50% and very much in line with the rest of the business.
i mean, obviously, lap is a lot of big numbers. but we're still driving growth, and we still see upside there because of our long-standing partnership with club and because we go to them with new innovation, just like the rest of our customers. but they're great partners, and we've really built the business there, and i talked about earlier that the cycle where we get trials through these other channels and many move and repeat into club, we see that as a long-term driver and model for the business.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then on competitive dynamics in the liquid space, rewind the clock to the time you were going public. there was obviously a lot of new brands coming in.
retailers were pushing with private label. growth attracts competition always and forever. and you're highlighting like the sustained very stellar growth there. are we still in sort of proliferation mode in terms of competitors trying to come in and get a piece of this? or have we begun to sort of shake out some of that and reconcentrate the category?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i mean, you described it well. this is a high-growth category so there's always going to be a lot of competition, and there has been. we have seen a little bit of shakeout on the specific 30-gram competitors, which seemed to hit a height when we went public. some of them have been discontinued, but there are some that will stay.
i think the way we look at it is even through all of the competitive entries throughout the last couple of years, we still have been able to grow double digits. so i hate the comment, ""competition is good."" but competition is not bad, especially when you're talking about a category that has such low household penetration. it means that people are driving new households, they're spending, they're bringing new people to the category. and we think that we bring something different to the category.
and so then just on the private label comment, interesting enough, private label this quarter has seen some softness within liquid. they're actually down, and some of the private label retailers have seen some issues around quality and supply. and so i think their understanding that this product form is complicated, and it's kind of what we've been touting for a long time.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
makes sense. thanks a lot. i will pass it on.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

welcome to bellring brands second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. hosting the call today from bellring brands are darcy davenport, president and chief executive officer; and paul rode, chief financial officer. today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 1:30 p.m. eastern time.
the dial-in number is (800) 585-8367, and the passcode is 5885539. [operator instructions] it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to jennifer meyer, investor relations of bellring brands, for introductions. you may begin.
jennifer meyer -- investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us today for bellring brands second-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. with me today are darcy davenport, our president and ceo; and paul rode, our cfo. darcy and paul will begin with prepared remarks, and afterwards, we'll have a brief question-and-answer session. the press release and supplemental slide presentations that support these remarks are posted on our website in both the investor relations and the sec filings sections at bellring.com.
in addition, the release and slides are available on the sec's website. before we continue, i would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that should be carefully considered by investors as actual results could differ materially from these statements. these forward-looking statements are current as of the date of this call, and management undertakes no obligation to update these statements. as a reminder, this call is being recorded and an audio replay will be available on our website.
and finally, this call will discuss certain non-gaap measures. for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the nearest gaap measure, see our press release issued yesterday and posted on our website. with that, i will turn the call over to darcy. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you all for joining us. last evening, we reported our second-quarter results and posted a supplemental presentation to our website. i'm pleased to report that our results were strong with net sales of $282 million and adjusted ebitda of $42 million. net sales were up 10% despite lapping a difficult comparable in the prior year driven by covid pantry loading on the premier protein brand.
dymatize grew an impressive 29% this quarter with strong results across channels and further benefiting from an easier international comparable. our first half results, combined with continued top line momentum, give us confidence to raise our outlook for the year. we now expect net sales to be between $1.17 billion and $1.2 billion, equaling growth of 18% to 21%, and exceeding our long-term algorithm of 10% to 12%. we are also raising our adjusted ebitda guidance range to between $214 million and $220 million.
we are excited about our sales momentum. however, we continue to experience cost pressure as inflation ramps up ahead of our expectations. our price increase on shakes, which goes into effect in the third quarter, combined with our cost-out programs, are largely offsetting the anticipated commodity and freight headwinds. on our powder business, we are expecting significant increases on whey protein and are pursuing opportunities to mitigate this additional margin pressure later this year and into next.
now turning to our category, brand highlights and growth strategies. the overall convenient nutrition category remains stable and healthy. we continue to see macro trends such as health and wellness, snacking and mainstreaming of protein driving category growth. liquid and powder momentum remains strong with growth outpacing historic rates driven by shelf space gains and strong velocities.
as mobility increases, we expect category growth to accelerate, providing additional tailwinds to the overall convenient nutrition category. premier protein shake consumption grew a healthy 20% this quarter across both tracked and untracked channels. this was on top of an elevated consumption quarter last year as a result of the covid stock-up. distribution gains, incremental promotional activity and strong velocities drove this growth.
all of our channels grew with ecommerce, food and mass leading the way, each growing nearly 60% compared to a year ago. as we lap the prior year pantry deload in q3, overall consumption has significantly accelerated in april, up 61%. however, even more encouraging, we are seeing strong sequential growth with consumption up 13% versus march. we continue to make great progress against our growth strategies.
premier protein's household penetration reached an all-time high of 7.4%, an increase of 12% over prior year. our repeat rate on 30-gram shake line remains at category-leading 51%, which highlights the strength of the brand and why we continue to believe in the long-term potential of this business. we had a great distribution build in q2 with brand tdps up 14% sequentially and 55% versus year ago. our rtb market share in tracked channels gained two percentage points, reaching 20.2%.
our national marketing campaign, which kicked off in january, performed well and was a clear contributor to our strong quarterly performance. our new flavors and pack sizes continue to drive significant growth in distribution. cafe latte and cinnamon roll remained in the top 15% of the category were sold. our newest flavor, choco peanut butter, was launched in ecommerce during q2.
it's off to a great start, quickly becoming our third strongest flavor in that channel. premier powders also had a fantastic quarter with tracked consumption up 144% driven by both distribution and velocity. now to dymatize. our strategy of expanding distribution to more mainstream channels is working.
the business was up 24% domestically driven by club, mass and ecommerce channels. we identified the right products and pack sizes for these channels, and the brand is responding well to dedicated media. iso100, fruity and cocoa pebbles are also bringing flavor excitement to the brand and driving velocities across all channels. our international sales grew 32% with both premier protein and dymatize contributing.
premier shakes in canada saw meaningful growth, supported by a successful club promotion and our first national digital media campaign. dymatize's international sales rebounded as we began to lap the covid impact of prior year. to close, i remain confident in our plans for 2021. our category is healthy, providing a significant tailwind.
we have a portfolio of strong brands that target complementary consumers. our advertising and promotions are working, driving growth and household penetration. our distribution continues to meaningfully build. our new products are generating consumer excitement and are thriving in market, and our innovation pipeline is the strongest it has ever been.
we know what drives our business, and our recent performance allows us to reinvest in those proven tactics and continue the growth cycle. i continue to be optimistic about our future, and i'm thankful for all the hard work of our employees, who make it happen every day. i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. net sales for the quarter were $282.1 million, up 9.6%. adjusted ebitda was $42.2 million, down 2.8%, and ebitda margin was 15%. as darcy indicated, our strong second quarter results were against a tough prior year comparable as we lap covid-related pantry loading.
premier protein net sales increased 8.2% primarily driven by rtd shakes. second quarter results benefited from distribution gains for both existing and new products and incremental promotional activity. premier protein net sales also benefited from strong growth in powder products and a favorable customer mix driven by increased fdm sales. dymatize net sales grew 28.8% this quarter driven by distribution gains in club and mass and continued strong ecommerce growth.
favorable product and customer mix were also a benefit to net sales growth. dymatize's international sales showed year-over-year growth as we begin to lap the covid-related declines in the prior year. turning back to consolidated results. gross profit of $87.0 million decreased 1.4% this quarter with an expected decrease in gross profit margin to 30.8%.
as we have previously discussed, this decline results from higher input costs, freight and planned incremental promotional activity. sg&a expenses were $48.2 million and as a percentage of net sales declined 130 basis points to 17.1%. sg&a expenses in the current year included $0.7 million of restructuring and facility closure costs related to our business realignment. these expenses were partially offset by $0.3 million of lower separation costs, both of which were treated as adjustments for non-gaap measures.
excluding these items, sg&a was flat compared to prior year by $2.2 million of higher marketing spend, reflecting expected leverage of our sg&a base. operating profit of $15.6 million decreased $19.5 million compared to prior year and was negatively impacted by $17.7 million of accelerated amortization. this was a noncash expense recorded in connection with our decision to discontinue our supreme protein brand and was treated as an adjustment for non-gaap measures. we expect the remaining $12 million of noncash accelerated amortization to be recorded in the third quarter.
before reviewing our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on cash flow. we had a strong second quarter for cash flow, generating $50 million from operations. as of march 31, net debt was $594 million, and net leverage was three times. in february, we completed an opportunistic repricing of our term loan.
this reduced our annual cash interest by approximately $8 million. we now expect cash interest expense for the year to be approximately $37 million, with $8 million in both q3 and q4. turning to our outlook. as darcy previewed, we are raising our fiscal 2021 net sales guidance range to $1.17 billion to $1.2 billion, with adjusted ebitda expected to range between $214 million and $220 million.
compared to prior year, our updated guidance implies top line growth in the second half of 24% to 30% and ebitda growth of 17% to 23%. sales are expected to grow sequentially, with ebitda roughly split across q3 and q4 as a result of higher planned promotional and marketing spend in q4. our revised guidance for ebitda contemplates higher-than-anticipated inflationary pressures, notably whey and milk proteins, which is expected to impact our second half gross margins. we are pleased with our performance through the first half.
our confidence in the bellring story remains unchanged. with that, i would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question is going to come from the line of andrew lazar, barclays.
andrew lazar -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
great. thanks for the questions. good morning, everybody. darcy, i wanted to start off with, maybe trying to compare a little bit, the severity of capacity constraints that bellring faced at the end of '18 and early '19, just sort of what you're seeing now.
back then, obviously, it forced the company to cut back on a couple of flavors and then, sort of, skus, maybe cut back on some promotional activity with key customers, and it certainly did impact the top-line performance pretty significantly. can you compare a little bit about what you're seeing now to then and if it requires you to pull back on flavors or skus or innovation in any way or promotional activities with key customers? that would be the first one.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so it is -- i would say it's pretty different from last time. so first of all, we have a healthy network of co-manufacturers. we've worked really hard to diversify and to add more co-manufacturers to our network.
and we are making significantly more shakes every quarter. so i mean, just to give a little more color than i did during the prepared remarks is, we just significantly grew faster than our best case that we forecasted. so we were prepared for a 20% increase, which was double our long-term algorithm. and we have flexibility to go even higher than that.
and we ended up growing 30%. and so -- and then the flex capacity that we thought we had that we are relying on was delayed to '22, and those were some of the reasons that i talked about before, which was around manufacturing delays and labor issues. so we went into our -- we basically dug into our inventory. and then -- and as you know, we've talked about how to add -- it takes some time to add capacity.
so you're right, we're going to -- we're not going to be forced to go as extreme as we did before, which was going down to two flavor strategies. what we will likely do is we're going to have to manage demand to supply for several quarters. and we will use the obvious levers, which would be both promotion and marketing to do so.
andrew lazar -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
yes. got it. and then i think last quarter, you mentioned that your, sort of, base planning assumptions for elasticity did not include competitors raising pricing. i have to assume, given what we've seen in costs for everybody that, generally, there's been a general raising of prices across the board, but which would make elasticity maybe a little bit more tenable anyway.
but i wanted to get a sense from you on how that's been progressing.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's exactly right. so -- and that is one of the factors that led to our beat in the quarter. the first was just around the category tailwinds, which were stronger than we expected.
but the second is around our assumptions around shake elasticity. we did assume that we would see some elasticity and a couple of things factored in. we just haven't. we haven't seen any hit to volume at all.
and it was really a result of a couple of things. one, retailers reflected at shelf later than we expected. and then also, as you said, competitors, there have been competitors follow. we just started seeing that late in the quarter.
and then lastly, we just -- we've actually seen volume increases instead of volume declines since we raised price.
andrew lazar -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of ken goldman, j.p. morgan.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. good morning. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. 
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
i wanted to first follow up on andrew's question about some of the balance between supply and demand. i think, darcy, you mentioned that it's -- you'll have to manage demand to supply for several quarters. i assume that your guidance for 2022 has been somewhat informed by that. is there any rough sense you can give? i know it's early and you're not giving full guidance at this time.
but rough sense of what you can give for how that 10% to 12% range has been, perhaps, affected by your relative inability to supply the demand at this time?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
we factored that into our preliminary estimates. and you're exactly right, ken. we're not ready to go into details into '22, but we did want to give you a sense that we still believe that we can grow 10% to 12% on top of the, kind of, outsized growth that we saw this year. and that's going to be coming from several different places.
it's going to be -- we're still going to see growth. we expect to still see growth in shakes. but we now have strong powder businesses, and we're going to -- we expect to see growth in powders as well.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. and then my follow-up, for premier over the 52 weeks, last 52 weeks, you showed a slide, you're growing almost as fast in supermarkets as you're going in ecom. i'm sure grocers are seeing these numbers, thinking about ways of expanding their visibility. darcy, you previously said we're not seeing any signs of a given space in a much more heavily traveled aisle soon.
so i guess i'm not going to ask about that, but what other steps can you take with your supermarket customers to improve your visibility and, sort of, take advantage of those velocity trends? and maybe it's just as simple as continuing to build more and better displays, but just wanted to, i guess, get your thoughts there.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's exactly right. we know what drives our business, displays are a really effective way -- within the tool set that we have right now, effective ways to bring in new consumers. i mean, i said this in my prepared remarks, but we're bringing in 80% of the new people into the category. so we are doing that even within the set, but display is really effective.
our advertising is really effective and just the product. so i think that what we're doing is working. those grocery and mass customers are seeing the tremendous growth. so there, we're both incented to continue to drive the category.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks so much.

and our next question will come from the line of pamela kaufman, morgan stanley.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. 
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
what factors do you see as contributing to the elevated demand that you've seen recently? and i guess, what's, kind of, driven it to be ahead of what you were planning for relative to your expectations?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
there were basically three areas that over-performed. and i referenced some of them when responding to andrew's question. but the first was the category. the category -- we haven't seen these types of increases in the category, really, ever.
the category was liquids was up 29% even in the quarter, but even some of that is due just a lapping covid. but even when you look at june and july, and when you get to june and july, you are no longer lapping the covid period. so that is pretty clean. and the category is still growing mid-double digits.
so if you think of what it was like pre-covid, we were seeing pretty much steady 5% to 6%. now we're seeing mid-double digits, but it's pretty dramatic. so -- and that goes back to, i hit some of the drivers from a consumer behavior standpoint in my prepared remarks, but we did conduct a study to really get under what is driving this, kind of, outsized category growth. and it was those things that i referenced.
consumers are looking to eat healthier. they are -- health, i mean we all know this. during this covid period, we are constantly thinking about how to improve our overall health. consumers are looking to lose weight after, kind of, a sedentary period.
they're looking to exercise more, and they're looking for, kind of, sports products. they're also seeking health advice and doctors are recommending this category, and they're recommending premier protein. and then there's also just some economic conditions as stimulus and america reopens, i mean traffic just generally is just very high. so those are all leading to, kind of, outsized category tailwinds that we were not expecting the gravity of it.
the second piece is around shape pricing elasticity. we did have some conservatism in our numbers. we're not seeing them. and then the third is really around dymatize.
we saw better-than-expected results out of specialty and international than we forecasted.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. and to what degree is the capacity that's coming online incremental to the original plan? and how much flexibility will you have to scale back on production if demand moderates?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
the new -- i mean the new capacity is all incremental. so the -- and then from a -- we always incorporate some flexibility into our forecast. so we will always be able to, kind of, dial it up and dial it down.
pamela kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question will come from the line of chris growe with stifel.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. good morning. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning. 
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi. i just had a question, if i could, first on -- to understand, i think, to paul, the pricing came through this quarter. you also talked about inflation, kind of, coming in ahead of your expectations. i just was curious, as you stand today, does pricing offset inflation? and is there a chance to go for more pricing, given some of the continued inflation you're seeing in your business?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes, you're correct. we have seen continued inflation, particularly on our powder business, and so that we have a price increase going into effect in q1 on that. and we're continuing to evaluate the level of price increase there because the increases on whey protein have really, really gotten much higher. on our shake business, our price increase is largely offsetting commodities.
but as they continue to rise, we'll continue to evaluate some additional levers to pull there. will offset that, especially as we look to 2022.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then i had a question, darcy, on supply and just thinking about when you run into these issues where you have a shortage of supply in some cases, just like the cost basis of your supply chain. so i'm just -- are there specific geographies, for example, now you've got a pretty good diverse supply of product where you have less of an inventory buffer, and therefore, you can have some more margin effect. and therefore, as you get back to kind of full production, you can actually get a better, kind of, lower-cost opportunity for your business.
does that make sense?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it makes perfect sense. and i'll start, and i'll let paul add on. but you're right. i mean we are -- during this period of time when we're low on inventory, we're basically shipping product wherever it is to wherever it needs to go, which is not efficient.
and so -- and we will continue doing that for several quarters until we build back up our inventory. and once we do, then we're going to see the benefit of that. so if you kind of -- obviously, we're going to -- this is all dynamic. but if i were betting, i think we'd see that toward the end of '22.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes, you're correct. i mean we do have some, what we call rate inefficiencies in our numbers, especially in q4. as to darcy's point, we are working hard to ship product wherever it needs to go, and that's not always going to be the most optimal cost. and as we expand our network, then it gives us even more flexibility to optimize freight.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
and our next question is going to come from the line of kaumil gajrawala, credit suisse.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. the first one is on investment spend in marketing. now that wellness has really taken off, obviously, this wouldn't have been part of the plan a couple of years ago, in particularly, powders. has this changed your investment plan or your capital deployment strategies?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. on powders, absolutely. so we see -- and i think it's -- we've seen great tailwinds on, kind of, our powder businesses, and that is both dymatize and premier protein. what i am excited about our powder portfolio is, we have two brands that go after two distinct consumers.
and they both are -- and we have figured out what drives those businesses. we have a ton of upside. i think there is tremendous opportunity, especially on, kind of, mainstream powders. if you look back at what premier did to rtds and -- meaning the kind of mainstreaming of that category.
i think that's coming in powders. we're starting to see it. i mentioned that everyday powders in track channels is now the same size as sports, which is a really big change in the category. so absolutely, we're planning on supporting powders.
we are -- because we've seen some, kind of, outsized demand on powder, we do need to build up our inventories again. we did -- our demand was higher than our capacity for powder, so we did dip into our inventory. but once we build that up, we're going to be supporting it strongly next year.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
if i could ask a question that's in some ways maybe linked to the first question, which is, in your prepared remarks as it relates to the post transaction, you mentioned liquidity, as well as something strategic. is m&a, maybe, now higher on your priority list, given that transaction and how you're looking at the categories?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
nothing has changed in our, kind of, general view on m&a. i mean i still think -- you've heard me say this many times, but we're focused on the -- our organic growth of our brands. we still believe that's the biggest opportunity. however, we are constantly looking at what's out there from an m&a perspective.
and so this definitely readies us even more to take advantage of those opportunities, but that's not the driving factor.
kaumil gajrawala -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. thank you.

and our next question will come from the line of bill chappell with truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
darcy, i fully get the pickup in health and wellness at the end of the pandemic and what your studies -- losing weight and feeling healthy or something like that. but did something in your findings see that shakes versus bars, kind of, tipped? because it seems like you're certainly outperforming the -- within the various forms and factors. and i didn't know that would seem, if we were all going back to work and on the go, maybe that would drive it. but i didn't know if there was some reason why you were seeing and if it was sustainable, that shakes are now really, kind of, stepping up even further.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so bars have, over time, i mean, they were -- if you think of the three form: bars, shakes, and powders, and the degree that those categories or subcategories have mainstreamed, bars have definitely mainstreamed first. so -- and when i say mainstreamed, bars have really become more of a snack food. the household penetration of bars is 50% or about 45%. and so it already really has gone from, i would say -- it's more of a healthier snack, but it is a snack, whereas both shakes and powders haven't gone there to that degree.
i mean, household penetration of shakes still at about 25%. so if you think, i mean, it could double just to get to where bars are. so i do believe -- and then powders is even lower from a household pen standpoint. i think there is more of an association of, kind of, proactive health there, from everything from, kind of, higher protein levels to immunity claims to vitamins and minerals.
i mean, the vitamin and minerals, so when we ask consumers why, from a nutritional standpoint, they purchase our shakes. it's #1 protein and second is the vitamin and mineral blend. so i think that, just, there is more of a health halo around both shakes and powders, where i think there's more of a snacking halo around bars.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. but nothing has really changed over the past four, five months, it's just, kind of, coming out that is kind of manifested?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i don't think anything has changed in -- from the product delivery standpoint. what i think has changed is just the intensity and the focus around health and wellness and their focus -- and also, i mean, the big reason why people enter the category is they want to lose weight. it's not about going to those weight management brands but people -- i mean, we get success stories all the time around people using premier protein and losing weight.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then one -- just a question on channel. i mean now you've come through a season of expanding even further into the club channel, where you probably have five times the number of skus that a normal cpg company would have in a club channel. i mean -- but you're still seeing strong growth there.
i guess looking forward, is there a possibility of further skus, further shelf space? is it just velocity here? or are we starting to see some maturation of that and most of the growth will come from non-club channels going forward?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean our -- i'm really pleased with our club channel growth. and really it is around velocities and traffic. i don't expect us to get a lot more distribution in the club channel, but i do think there's a lot of upside just from a household penetration and just the more people even -- just leveraging the incredible, kind of, traffic that the club channel is getting right now.
i mean, their traffic numbers are off the charts, and it's really impressive. so i think that we'll be leveraging their increased traffic, as well as there's a lot of upside just from a household penetration standpoint on our brand in the club channel.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the color.

hey, good morning, everyone. so i wanted to ask a question just about the capacity expansion and just get a little bit more color on a couple of items. one is just, it sounded like, darcy, from your prepared remarks, was this a project that's already been delayed?i think you mentioned something about other companies having issues getting equipment. so i guess that's my first question is just, when did this start? has it already been delayed is the first question.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so yes. so i would say it is a twofold problem, i guess. so the first was outsized demand, which i talked about that. the second was our -- when you think about our flex capacity, that -- to get that flex capacity, we were relying on new lines to come in to our existing co-manufacturers.
there was -- we were expecting to see approximately nine lines, only four came in. so only 4 got put into our co-man network, five got delayed to next year. so that is what i was talking about. i think that if those lines came in, i think that we'd be in a different situation.
however, i want to just be super clear, our co-mans are amazing, and they have delivered on their commitments. and they've done extraordinary work for us to support our business throughout this pandemic. so i have nothing but positive to say about our co-man.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. no, i appreciate that. i just -- i think we've all had experiences with difficulty buying everything from patio stones to lumber and just, projects have been delayed. i'm just trying to get a sense for what's the risk of further delay.
like is the equipment already in transit being delivered? is there a labor issue in terms of getting the lines up and running? just, it'd be great to know like what percentage of what needs to be done to get those lines up and running next year has been completed. or like where are we in the time line of that project? and is there a possibility for further delays?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and it's really not one project, and it's not one co-man. so it's -- we're basically adding capacity every quarter. and we are adding -- and when i say we, i mean in partnership with our co-man partners.
so they're adding capacity, so some of it is labor. the situation that i was told by the ceo of one of our partners was they have four lines and every weekend, they don't have enough labor to run -- one sits idle. one line sits idle because they don't have the labor to run it. so that just gives you an example.
so right there in that situation, the capacity is in there. it's just about training, getting enough labor. and these are the talent -- high-talent labor. and so it's about training them and bringing them in.
that is well on its way. there are different situations where we are -- we've already gotten the equipment and it's being installed. and then there are other ones that are more long lead where -- that we're waiting for the equipment to be delivered. so i would say there are various time lines that we have factored in and we have been conservative in our projections.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. that's helpful. thanks, darcy.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question is going to come from the line of rob dickerson with jefferies.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks so much. darcy, just, kind of, a general question around the capacity again, but, kind of, how it differs potentially for you relative to the category?obviously, it sounds like category growth is [indiscernible] is far ahead of where it was just two 2 years ago. my assumption is you are likely or hopefully not the only company in this situation.
so i guess, kind of, a direct question was just, as you get through this increased capacity build to meet demand, as you look out throughout the category in your competition, do you feel like others are in a similar situation such that your actual market share should not be strained because others might be able to fill in that demand more quickly than you?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we are not alone. so the entire aseptic processing network is constrained. so if anyone is trying to get more capacity than they have already contractually committed to, it's going to be difficult. it's going to be -- it's going to take some time until the network catches up to this amazing increase of demand.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then just mechanically for you paul. i know there's a question earlier around m&a.
darcy saying you're thinking about capital allocation in the same way, continue to look at pipeline. i heard on the other call this morning and, kind of, saw in the release, it sounds like post distribution from post, that leverage to be at a rate similar to the ipo. and i just actually had a number of people keep asking this. the one question is, kind of, what is that leverage ratio when you went public?and then secondly, as you think through that special dividend, just to clarify, it sounds like what is implied here is just that cash would be coming out of bellring, but you're going to put more leverage on the business, pay the special dividend and then you'll reset from there.
so kind of indirectly, it sounds like it'd be fair to assume that further acquisitions wouldn't be a near-term event, especially given the capacity constraints and the special dividend.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. so rob, this morning, did touch on the leverage that was similar to the ipo time line. so that range was near four times. it is just below four times.
but as a company, we're a fast-growing business that generates tremendous cash flow, and we de-lever very quickly. and so our expectation would be, while you may be right at a point in time, a large m&a transaction may be a little more challenging at that leverage level, but we can de-lever so quickly that we don't see it as an impact related to our near-term strategy to seek m&a.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then just quickly, darcy, i'm not sure i heard you in the prepared remarks, just talk about how having a co-man supply chain can actually potentially benefit you on the margin side relative to others that have it in-house? and then just speak with other companies, right, if there's a lot of upside. you're getting a lot of volumes.
you're actually -- and the commodity environments normalized. it might get a lot of upside margin but if it goes down, they might actually put pressure a lot more with the co-man that's usually absorbed a little bit by those co-manufacturers. so i'm just curious if you could just, kind of, touch on that and how that may or may not help you going forward.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
paul, i'm going to let you tackle this one.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
is your question around -- maybe could you restate your question? i'm not sure i fully tracked it.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
it's just sometimes co-manufacturers absorb some of the costs, right, that you would have to absorb internally if you had a full in-house manufacturing. so i'm not sure if that's right, trying to get color on that.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes, i can't speak for what others do. i think from our perspective, we control the buys of the major commodities. so we're buying the proteins because we believe that we can, with our scale of leverage, get the best buy of those proteins. there are some smaller things that our co-mans buy that -- we try to leverage where they have advantages to cost and then where we have advantages to cost.
and then that's -- so that's how we see as, kind of, our competitive advantages as we're optimizing that on both ends. but i can't speak for how others work on that.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our final question will come from the line of ken zaslow with bank of montreal.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
hi, ken. 
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
you look at the elasticity and through the findings, it seems like your elasticity is actually fairly low and that there's able to be price increases. we've seen other companies called the confectionery companies who, kind of, transition a little bit toward making more frequent pricing changes, price increases rather than just doing it when there's inflation. would you consider that as an option, given the low elasticity that you have?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
i mean we would. i think for now, we are still looking -- we are a growth brand. we are trying to expand. we believe that we are, sort of, in the early innings of the premier protein brand growth.
we still have a ton of upside from a household penetration standpoint. we have a ton of upside from a market share standpoint. we're excited to grow the liquid category and have more people use this category and our brand. so i think that would be the reason why we would not, just because we are still wanting to grow as fast as we can.
now if we see increase -- those are always part of our evaluation as we're looking at rising costs, etc. i mean, there is a cliff at some point. we aren't seeing it now, but we're probably not seeing it because of the other competitors have brought it. also, we didn't see it until many of our retailers didn't raise price until the middle of the quarter.
but -- and we're going to be watching it closely.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. my second question is on repeat purchases, what was your repeat purchase? and what do you attribute to and what can you learn from those findings to do something better going forward? i'll leave it there.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. our repeat rate has stayed over 50%, and that's for the last five years. so you think about from 2017 to now, how much our business has changed. i mean we've doubled household penetration, but yet our repeat has stayed above 50%, which is really -- i mean it's one of the top repeat rates in the category.
so i think it's just a testament to an amazing product that consumers absolutely love. i mean one of the metrics that we track is around brand love, and that's really important. and so we want to always make sure that we are, kind of, surprising and delighting our consumers with -- and that's going to look -- we look across a lot of different, kind of, touch points. it's everything from new flavors to our improvement on our shake, around immunity.
it includes all kinds of different improvements to the product, as well as expanding. so i think that our goal is to keep that as high as possible. and based on the track record, i think we'll do that.

welcome to bellring brands third-quarter 2021 earnings conference call and webcast. hosting the call today from bellring brands are darcy davenport, president and chief executive officer; and paul rode, chief financial officer. today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning at 1:30 p.m. eastern time.
the dial-in number is 1 (800) 585-8367. and the passcode is 7479008. [operator instructions]it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to jennifer meyer, investor relations, bellring brands, for introductions. you may begin.
jennifer meyer -- investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us today for bellring brands third-quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. with me today are darcy davenport, our president, and ceo; and paul rode, our cfo. darcy and paul will begin with prepared remarks and afterwards, we'll have a brief question-and-answer session. the press release and supplemental slide presentation that support these remarks are posted on our website in both the investor relations and the sec filings section of bellring.com.
in addition, the release and slides are available on the sec's website. before we continue, i would like to remind you that this call will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that should be carefully considered by investors as actual results could differ materially from these statements. these forward-looking statements are current as of the date of this call, and management undertakes no obligation to update these statements. as a reminder, this call is being recorded, and an audio replay will be available on our website.
and finally, this call will discuss certain non-gaap measures. for a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the nearest gaap measure, see our press release issued yesterday and posted on our website. with that, i will turn the call over to darcy. 
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you all for joining us. last evening, we reported our third-quarter results and posted a supplemental presentation to our website. i'm happy to report that we turned in a record quarter with net sales of $342 million and adjusted ebitda of $70.5 million. performance exceeded our expectations, lifted by success of our growth initiatives and tremendous category momentum.
premier protein and dymatize grew net sales 65% and 99%, respectively, driven by distribution gains, strong velocities, and favorable category tailwinds. following our better-than-expected third-quarter results, we are once again raising our outlook for the year. we now expect net sales to grow at 27% to 30% for the year. we're also raising our adjusted ebitda guidance range to between $230 million and $235 million.
we continue to experience meaningful cost pressure. however, our price increase on shakes, upcoming powder pricing actions, and our cost-out programs are helping to offset these headwinds. as a result of accelerated growth, coupled with network delays in adding tetra capacity, we have run into short-term supply constraints. over the next several quarters, we are adding significant capacity into our existing co-manufacturers, as well as expanding our co-manufacturing network.
delays in 2021 capacity stem from the same issues i expect that you've heard from other companies, challenges with equipment delays, and limitations on labor. while we expect inventory will be low for several quarters, our organization has experience managing in this environment, while focusing on our priorities to deliver for our long-term growth objectives. we faced capacity challenges before and thrived on the other side, and i expect a similar outcome again. we'll provide fiscal '22 guidance in november, but to preview, we expect net sales growth and adjusted ebitda margin to be well within our long-term algorithm.
we will give more context in detail in the november call. turning to this quarter. we are seeing tremendous growth in the convenient nutrition category. ready-to-drink beverages grew 29% versus a year ago, but even more impressive is the sequential growth [audio gap]
paul rode -- chief financial officer
[audio gap] adjusted ebitda was $70.5 million, up 83% and ebitda margin was 20.6%. our top-line performance is very strong across all brands. also, results further benefited from category tailwinds, as well as lapping the covid-related impacts in the prior year. premier protein net sales increased 65%, primarily driven by rtd shakes.
distribution gains, strong velocities, and better performing promotions drove this growth. additionally, we lapped the negative covid impacts in the prior-year period. last, shake net sales growth outpaced volume growth, reflecting list price increases taken in the third quarter in favorable product and customer mix when compared to prior year. dymatize net sales nearly doubled this quarter, growing 99% and benefited from lapping the negative covid impacts in specialty and international markets in the prior-year period.
strong distribution gains of velocities were the primary contributor to the brand's exceptional growth. favorable product and customer mix drove an improvement in average net selling prices. turning back to consolidated results. gross profit of $111.3 million increased 62% this quarter, with an expected decrease in gross profit margin to 32.5%.
as we have previously discussed, this decline resulted from higher freight and input costs. sg&a expenses were $42.6 million, and as a percentage of net sales declined 360 basis points to 12.4%, reflecting leverage of our sg&a base. this leverage was achieved by $3.4 million of incremental marketing and consumer advertising expenses and higher incentive compensation accruals. operating profit of $51.5 million increased 68% or $21 million compared to prior year and was negatively impacted by $11.8 million of accelerated amortization.
this was a noncash expense recorded in connection with our decision to discontinue our supreme protein brand and was treated as an adjustment for non-gaap measures. the supreme brand was fully amortized in the third quarter. we had a strong third quarter for cash flow, generating $72 million from operations. as of june 30, net debt was $529 million, and net leverage was 2.3 times.
turning to our outlook. as darcy previewed, we are raising our fiscal 2021 net sales guidance range to $1.25 billion to $1.28 billion, with adjusted ebitda expected to range between $230 million and $236 million. we expect our strong sales and category momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. organic growth, distribution gains, planned promotional activity and our shape price increase are driving net sales growth.
whey protein and freight inflation have continued to rise ahead of our expectations, and along with milk protein inflation will pressure year-over-year gross margins. recall our fourth quarter typically carries the lowest gross margins driven by the volume of promotional activity in the fourth quarter. we expect sg&a leverage to offset a portion of the gross margin decline. we are thrilled with our year-to-date performance.
our confidence in the bellring story remains unchanged. with that, i would like to turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

[operator instructions] and we will go first today to andrew lazar with barclays. your line is open.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you so much. good morning, everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
first, i want to start out maybe with some of the strategic adjustments that you mentioned that you're working with retailers to manage through some of the supply constraints. maybe you can talk a little bit about what you're seeing along these lines on the competitive front. i guess, are others having similar issues? or, you know, could there be some risk of more permanent shelf space losses even though velocity of premier, you know, clearly remains very strong?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
right. so, i'll give a little more color on our temporary sku reductions. so, we are looking at just reducing our -- the bottom velocity skus temporarily. so, we're looking at reducing four skus on our 30-gram line.
from a competitive standpoint, this is absolutely an industrywide problem. anybody who is in 30 -- the 330 ml shakes, which is our size of shake, is, you know, facing capacity constraints that they're looking for incremental volume. the other thing is on bottles. so, some of our competitors are producing bottles, and they're facing supply constraints as well.
it's different. they have different issues, but there are issues with the foil on top that close the seal on bottles as well as evoh filters. so, there are a lot of different supply constraints that are affecting the industry. and so -- and when you -- if you go out to the marketplace, you see out-of-stocks across the board from -- in the competition landscape.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
thank you for that. and then, you've talked more recently about your sort of volume elasticity assumptions in regard to some of the pricing and that you were taking a somewhat, you know, conservative view, you know, not assuming that others necessarily follow pricing. i'm assuming the whole industry, obviously, in facing all of this, has been taking pricing pretty aggressively. maybe you can update us on what you're seeing from an elasticity perspective, even though i know it's still somewhat early in the game with all the pricing coming through.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
we've really seen zero elasticity. we took price and our volumes went up. so, but yes, competitors have followed in the rtd space. we're starting to see pretty dramatic -- and we talked about it in the last call, and paul can provide more color.
but we've seen some rapid escalation on whey specifically, which is the predominant ingredient in our -- on our powder side of the business. and we are -- we took price as of 10/1 on our powder business, and we are also seeing competition take price on whey as well. you know, as we look forward, i think we're -- in just the recent month -- in just this last month, we continue to see whey increase further. so, i expect that competition as well as we will be looking at additional pricing on powder.
andrew lazar -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we will take our next question from chris growe with stifel. your line is open.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hi, good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
just had a question, a bit of a follow-on to andrew's question. i know, paul, you had mentioned double-digit inflation in the first half of the year. as you see it today, what's the sort of inflation you expect overall for the year? and then, do you expect pricing to be up as you -- based on the inflation you see today, pricing to offset inflation as you know today?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yes. my comment was the double-digit inflation for our full year.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
when we -- as darcy mentioned, we have seen a run-up in the last 30 days, really, especially on whey proteins, a little bit less on milk proteins, but whey protein continues to be sharper. so, when we -- you know, if you asked us this question three months ago, the expectation was that whey protein was going to be a significant headwind in the first half and then the pricing -- the cost started to come down in the second half. what we're now seeing is that cost stays elevated throughout our fiscal year, and so that puts a lot of pressure on our powder margins because of that. so, as darcy mentioned what the latest increase in cost on whey, it seems likely that we need to take further pricing to offset cost on our powder business.
the inflation on our shake business is, you know, in the single digits, something we're continuing to monitor and assessing if we need to take further pricing actions on our shake business.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then, just a quick question, darcy, around the new production manufacturing capacity that post is putting in place. i know that when you went through this situation a few years ago, you had a pretty clear plan, a multiyear plan for, you know, building capacity through your third-party manufacturers to levels that would, you know, fully support your business and your growth outlook.
obviously, there's little things have happened, the pandemic and -- has caused it to be a little short. i guess i'm trying to understand is, you know, presumably, before post announced this new facility, you had a plan for incremental capacity to meet your demand. is post displacing some of that capacity? or just -- is it going to be incremental or an additional? and do you need it, i guess? do you have the capacity you think at that point in time to meet demand once that new facility is online?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so, i love the little thing called the pandemic. yes. so, we have a multiyear strategic plan around adding co-mans.
actually, rob talked a little bit about it on the post call. just to step back, currently have five locations. you know, we are looking at having eight to 10 in, call it, five years. post is a part of that and an important part of that, but we are looking to continue to diversify our co-manufacturing locations throughout the country.
and i think one of the changes, kind of, i would say, the evolution of our strategy from a co-man standpoint is we are really -- we're leaning into volume. so, we're being more aggressive at moving forward. i think we see what our business can do. we still believe that we are in the early innings of both household penetration of the category, household penetration of our brands, distribution, as well as we still have not fully marketed premier protein.
so, we are absolutely leaning into kind of high side of our models, and post is a part of that. i think, just the last thing i would say is our fifth location is -- that we currently have. i think i've talked about this, that it's a dedicated facility to premier protein. we like that.
we like that it increases our control. and so, that is -- if you think of the post expansion and partnership, that's just kind of that same path but accelerated. so, we're -- we like -- it's obviously, a sister brand, which gives us more control.
chris growe -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thanks for all the time.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks.
operator
we will take our next question today from david palmer with evercore isi. your line is open.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
just a question on the points of distribution. that's great detail. how much do you think that 25% reduction in points of distribution since june hurt your consumption?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
it's interesting. i mean, we grew 30% this quarter. so, here is the fascinating thing. and i think one of the reasons why i get so excited about premier protein is the loyalty.
so, what we find -- so let's go back. in 2018, when we had a failure of a co-man, and we had to pull back to two flavors. we went to chocolate and vanilla. what we found is, first of all, many of our retail partners actually held the space for us.
the second piece was our consumers. we actually didn't lose household penetration. our consumers just bought chocolate and vanilla. and so, i think that we have such loyal consumers that actually, our consumption doesn't really go down.
i mean, like you said, we lost some -- temporarily lost some tdps this last quarters because of out-of-stocks, and our consumption still grew 30%.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. it's amazing. just thinking about your margin guidance, it would seem that your gross margins, that would be equivalent to where you're guiding for '22, might be in the 30% range or so, i mean, which would be well below where it was in fiscal '19. i just wonder, do you see a path back to mid-30s gross margins? and if so, when do you think you would get there? and i'll pass it on.
thanks.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
sure. i'll take that. yes. so, if you go back to '19, you know, much different dynamics in 2019 and that the inflationary situation is obviously much different now than it was then.
in 2019, we took a price increase, which was actually a little bit of ahead of inflation. and so we really saw, you know, very high margins. as we look at '22, as you described it, you described it correctly, how we're thinking about it. there is compression, and the compression is largely on our protein powder business.
the magnitude of the whey protein increases, we're looking at 2x protein cost versus a year ago, and even more meaningful in the first half, you know, as we look at as margin. so, really, this is there's two main things that are impacting our margins and thinking of potential compression. one is the whey protein costs. the other is, we do -- we are experiencing some logistics inefficiencies.
we saw some in the fourth quarter. we expect to see more in the first half, and that's related to our lower inventory levels. so, that's requiring us to cross-country ship and expedite and do different things to try to get product to our customers, our retail partners as quickly as possible. so, that is also weighing on margins.
but it is a little bit -- it's a different situation for 2019 mainly because of the inflationary environment.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great, thank you.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
let's get back to your -- sorry, to get back to your last question, yes, we do see a path. obviously, we think the whey protein costs are transitory. it's going to come back down. we're not going to stay at historical highs.
so, we can expand our gross margin there. and we think there are paths on shakes as well. darcy talked about, you know, we're expanding the number of our co-mans. that gives us some geographic diversification as well, which should improve freight rates.
we do think we have pricing power on the brand. so, we do think there is a path to get back to the margins that we've typically seen in the past. but obviously, in this inflation environment, it's still a little more challenging.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks, guys.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i just wanted to add one thing. obviously, you guys know this, but the pricing power is -- i mean, just going back to the brand loyalty, and the brand loyalty is not just limited to premier protein. we have incredible brand loyalty also on the dymatize business.
and so, obviously, that is required when you think about pricing power. and we have shown that on both businesses that we can price for this inflation and consumers stick with us. so, -- and it's really -- this inflation is affecting all -- everybody in the category. so, you know, we feel like we're in a good place.
david palmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks.
operator
we will go next to ken zaslow with bank of montreal. your line is open.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so, i'm going to go to a little bit earlier question. how is your planning of this process? i look back at your last quarter and how you guys were fairly confident in the structure. so, what actually failed in your planning process? and how do we ensure in two years from now that we don't have to go through this again and this becomes a two to three-year episodical event?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, we ended up -- i mean, i think we've talked about we grew two years in one this year. in essence, we ended up the year up 26%. that was largely due to premier protein. and that -- so, we usually plan three years out.
and when you end up growing two years in one, that accelerates that amount. and what happened, that in combination with the network, the co-manufacturing network, the expansions were delayed. that put us in the situation that we are now. i would say what is different and what we have learned is what you're seeing in our manufacturing strategy.
and that is what we are talking about before. it includes diversification. the second is leaning more into the high side. so, what we had done in the past was we had take-or-pays that largely protected the downside.
but then we relied a little bit more on that flex capacity that i have talked about before. and which because we're the no. 1 brand in the category, we usually got that flex capacity. well, unfortunately, during the supply chain in the pandemic, that flex capacity went away.
so, we didn't get it. and so going forward, we're now guaranteeing the kind of high side. and then, in addition, we are diversifying our co-mans. so, if you think of a few years ago, we really had most of our volume in one co-man.
we now have five locations. moving forward, we will have probably doubled that. and then, the third piece is these dedicated locations where it is focused just on premier protein, and so we're enhancing our control and even more so with a sister company within post. so, i would say those three kind of evolutions of the strategy is why i do not believe that we will have this time -- this kind of issue in the future.
however, i will say, it's hard to recover from two years in one.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
ken, i just --
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i'm not minimizing that -- yes.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
ken, i would just add -- really, what i would just add is, you know, keep in mind, this category absolutely accelerated, you know, beyond expectation. i mean, it's been a category that the growth rate, you know, more than doubled over the last six to nine months and it happened very quickly. so, i think they caught, you know, a number of companies off guard. you can see on the shelves as you go out to the stores and look, you know, in our category, it's caught a number of companies off guard.
but to darcy's point, i think we're doing a lot of things to anticipate and to grow this business. but, you know, when the category accelerates like it did, obviously, it catches everybody a little bit off guard, i think.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i wasn't minimizing that. i was minimizing position from last quarter to this quarter in terms of planning. but i'll take that offline. and then, the other question i have is when i think about 2023, with all this stuff behind us, do you think that your earnings potential changes or you're on a new base, which you will grow from that? how do you kind of frame the 2023, 2024 thought process in terms of either earnings power or earnings base with a growth off that? can you recover? and i'll leave it there, and i appreciate your time.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so, i actually will go back to your comment because i don't think i addressed it, ken. just what changed since august? the main thing of what changed is our co-man. so, demands continued to -- consumption continued to increase.
and then -- but the bigger thing is our supply chain. we had attainment misses by our co-mans because of both some covid issues as well as labor. so, those were the two pieces. so, -- and happy to talk more about that offline.
on -- from a '23 standpoint, so this is where we can go back and look at history. and what happened in -- when we had some demand shaping in the past is the following year had accelerated growth. and i expect that that would be the same. obviously, it's early in '22, and so, i don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves.
but we will have added capacity coming online. throughout this year, we basically have capacity coming on every single quarter. capacity grows every single quarter, and our revenue grows with that. but then, in '23, we will be, you know, reintroducing the flavors that we pulled back on.
we'll reengage marketing and promotion. so, i think there's definitely an opportunity to be above algorithm on the topline.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so, with the new capacity, you would argue that you would go into the capacity and not grow off a bit. so, the capacity expansion would be your new base as you fill it. is that fair? and i'm sorry that i did an extra to-be question. i'll leave at that.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
correct. correct.
ken zaslow -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.

we will go next to pamela kaufman with morgan stanley. your line is open.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
you mentioned that you expect production to exceed shipments in fiscal '22. how do you think about the trade-off between rebuilding inventories versus meeting the strong demand in the market and preserving your market share performance?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
for us, right now, inventories are just too low. we need to be able to service our customers on a consistent basis. and so that requires a minimal amount of inventory and safety stock. so, we need to get to that minimum amount, and then we can -- and that's what we're talking about.
so, the differential between shipments and consumption is really just rebuilding and getting to that basic amount of safety stock so we can service them consistently.
pam kaufman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and then, you also mentioned that you're adjusting your marketing and promotional activities in light of the supply shortages. can you talk about what changes you're making? will there be a different cadence of promotional events this year or just less marketing? thank you.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, i'll hit the strategy, and i'll pass it to paul to discuss cadence. from -- yes, we're pulling back -- we'll be pulling back on promotion and marketing. we'll still have some kind of social, digital. our strategy on marketing changes a little bit.
it becomes more about sustaining. we have -- part of our loyalty for our brands is kind of the one-to-one communication that we have via social and digital. we'll continue that. but, you know, we're not going to have any television advertising like we've had in the past.
and then, in addition, we'll be pulling back on promotion. so, we will -- and then i'll pass it to paul for cadence.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, if you look at '21 from a marketing perspective, it was heaviest in our second quarter. so, obviously, that will be a benefit to ebitda growth year over year in a promotional perspective. q4 and q2 are our biggest promotional quarters.
q4 is our biggest. so, again, by pulling back on promotion, that will be a net positive ebitda perspective. and so, that's how we're thinking about the cadence. from a marketing perspective, i would expect marketing to be a bit lighter in the first half.
and then, as we sequentially grow our topline, we'll, you know, grow marketing, start to add back marketing with it.

and we will go next to ben bienvenu with stephens. your line is open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
good morning.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i want to ask first a quick question about guidance, and then a follow-up just about the capacity ramp. on guidance, i think probably, paul, this is for you, you talked about pricing increases that you're planning on taking. you also talked about considering additional pricing increases on our rtd shakes. is -- does the guidance that you provided include taking more price to offset inflation? or would that be incremental to the guidance that you provided?
paul rode -- chief financial officer
it would be incremental. but just to clarify, so, yes, there's two price increases that we have already taken that will affect fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21. we took a price increase on our shake business in april. so, we'll get a half-year benefit of that price increase.
and we took a price increase at the beginning of our fiscal year '22. so, in october, we took a price increase on our powder business, a double-digit price increase. so, we'll get the full year benefit of that. our guidance does not contemplate further price increases outside of the promotional pullback that we just talked about.
so, there's -- that's the third piece, i guess, of the pricing. but as we look at the rest of the year, we are not contemplating additional pricing on powder and shakes. as darcy highlighted earlier, with the ramp-up recently of whey, it's likely that will take further pricing on the powder side.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. ok. perfect. my second question is just related to the capacity you expect to see during the year.
with discontinuities in the supply chain, to what extent does that impede your ability or your visibility into the ramp in that capacity? and concurrent with that, to what extent does diversifying your co-man footprint mitigate the risk of supply chain discontinuities to the -- you know, hitting the schedule on ramping your capacity?
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
so, we are adding -- i mentioned this in my prepared remarks. so, we are adding, you know, in the mid-teens, basically capacity. and it adds every quarter. what i will say is, we're adding to both existing co-mans, as well as additional co-mans.
in essence, you know, a co-man for q2, q3, q4. there are several key milestones for adding capacity, maybe obvious, but might be helpful. so, you know, there is ordering of the equipment. there's delivery of the equipment, and then there is installation and, you know, start-up.
they all have -- especially in today's world where there's supply chain disruptions all the time, they all have, you know, some risk. a lot of the risk is around delivery and shipments. so, of the three new -- we basically have three locations that are adding equipment. and two out of the three have already received the equipment.
so, that takes out some risk right there. and then, the third is expecting it later this month. so, that, to me, de-risks the new capacity a ton. then, it becomes just around installation and labor.
and then these are supposed to come on q2, q3, q4. so, we're feeling very good about de-risking our plan and around that capacity coming on. the other piece is, for '22, the bulk of our volume, our capacity is actually coming from existing co-mans. so, that also is a piece.
and we've been pretty conservative on our outlook about what they can -- the attainment targets that we've baked into our guidance. the last question you asked about how more co-mans help diversify that risk, absolutely. it absolutely does, and that's why that's a key aspect of -- you know, we've already diversified a fair amount over the last several years. we'll continue to diversify.
and like i said, we're looking to within, you know, three to five years, double the number of co-mans that we have, which will help.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. very, very helpful. thanks so much.
darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer

darcy davenport -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jennifer, and thank you all for joining us. last evening, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and posted a supplemental presentation slide. 2021 was a strong year for bellring. net sales grew 26% to just under 1.25 billion with adjusted ebitda of 234 million.
due to supply chain disruptions, our fourth quarter net sales finished strong at 340 million, up 20%, and adjusted ebitda was 60.5 million. consumption meaningfully grew across both brands, with premier protein rtd shakes up 30% and dymatize powders up 50% across both tracked and untracked channels despite both brands experiencing some out-of-stocks. margins remained strong but were lessened by rapid escalation in protein and freight costs. paul will provide more detail about the quarter, but i want to step back and reflect on how the covid-19 pandemic has affected the convenient nutrition category, as well as our brands.
since the pandemic started, people went from being reactive recipients of healthcare to proactive consumers of health and wellness solutions. in response, consumers saw more engaged ways to keep themselves and their families protected from this virus. the result was a massive consumption increase of nutrition products, especially functional drinks that offer energy and immune health benefits. the trend of preventative and proactive health existed before the pandemic, but covid-19 drastically accelerated the importance of self-care.
then, in mid-2021, as the country was reopening, the convenient nutrition category benefited from an additional tailwind, the renewed desire by many consumers to get back in shape and lose their covid-19 weight gain, driving additional households into the category. as of september 30th, household penetration of ready-to-drink liquids and ready-to-mix powders were both at all-time highs. both premier protein and dymatize brands are perfectly positioned to take advantage of these long-term trends as they are trusted leading brands with strong loyalty. in 2021, bellring largely drove this incremental category expansion with strong execution across our growth strategies, including successful distribution gains, effective marketing campaigns, and new product trials.
premier protein became a $1 billion brand this year, and dymatize proved to have strong mainstream appeal, becoming a significant growth contributor to bellring. we now have two leading brands with strong prospects. however, this year's expansion came with some growing pains. our sales outpaced production for both shakes and powders.
supply chain disruptions affected our entire industry, including labor shortages and equipment delays, impacting our ability to access the anticipated level of flex production. as a result, we depleted safety stock, and year-end inventories are too low, leading to out-of-stocks in the marketplace. we are partnering with our retailers, and as the no. 1 brand in our segment, they are working with us as we make strategic adjustments to improve our service levels.
good news is inventory levels are starting to improve. we are adding shake capacity in our existing co-manufacturers and expanding our co-manufacturing network. in 2022, we expect shake production to increase in low -- to the low to mid-teens. however, this is not enough to satisfy our robust demand and build back safety stock at the same time.
as a result, we are temporarily reducing some of our lower velocity tetra shake skus in addition to pulling back on promotion and marketing. expect our production growth will outpace shipments because much of the new production will be used to replenish safety stock and return to adequate service levels. beyond '22, we are aggressively investing in shake production through numerous long-term volume commitment. i'm pleased to announce that we have entered into an agreement with post to build a shake processing facility, which will be dedicated to premier protein.
we are excited to leverage our relationship with post, specifically the aseptic manufacturing knowledge in its food service business. now to our outlook. as you saw in yesterday's press release, we expect fiscal '22 net sales and adjusted ebitda to grow between 9% and 13%. this guidance is consistent with our long-term algorithm despite our outsized growth in '21 and capacity strength in '22.
net sales growth is back half weighted and sequentially grows every quarter as new capacity comes online. growth in powder volumes, price increases on both brands, and reduced trade promotions drive year-over-year sales growth. this growth, coupled with reduced marketing and improved sg&a leverage, will ultimately drive ebitda gains despite significant inflation. before closing, i would like to share that, in october, bellring and post signed a transaction agreement related to post's previously announced intention to distribute its interest in bellring to post shareholders.
we believe, upon completion of the proposed transaction, bellring will have increased strategic flexibility to manage our capital structure and should benefit from more liquidity in our shares. as part of the agreement, post will continue to provide certain services to bellring for up to three years to facilitate a smooth transition. we had a phenomenal 2021, and the future remains bright for both our products and our categories. our growth is firing on all cylinders.
despite current supply constraints, we continue to invest in our innovation pipeline`, bringing product news to consumers and growing our category. our strong demand, combined with supply chain challenges, create a clear organizational focus for '22, aggressively build supply, and be ready to turn on demand driving engine as soon as supply allows. i want to thank our employees and our co-man and retail partners for all the hard work that made '21 such a successful year. i will now turn the call over to paul.
paul rode -- chief financial officer
thanks, darcy, and good morning, everyone. this morning, i will briefly review category and brand highlights, followed by our financial results, and close with our outlook. the convenient nutrition category continues to show remarkable growth. ready-to-drink beverages grew 20% versus a year ago with the ready-to-mix powders growing 18%.
rtd beverages, once again, added 2 points to household penetration with the average buy rate growing 11% versus a year ago. as darcy discussed, strong consumer tailwinds are driving these gains. our growth strategies are working well. premier protein's household penetration reached another all-time high of 8.4%, up 20% over prior year.
our repeat rate and buy rate on our 30-gram shake line remains strong and stable. we saw tremendous distribution gains this year. however, our tdps declined this quarter pressured by out-of-stocks. premier protein powders are showing great momentum with tracked consumption up 76% for the quarter.
we're pleased with this year's performance of premier powders and look forward to growing this product further in 2022. dymatize continues to benefit from expanded distribution across mainstream channels. velocities remain strong, and it continues to perform in the top third of the categories were sold in the u.s. moving to our financial results.
net sales for the quarter were 340 million, up 20.3%. adjusted ebitda was 60.5 million, up 6.7% and ebitda margins were 17.8%. our topline performance remained very strong across all brands, but our sales growth was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions. this caused lower-than-anticipated production, which exacerbated already low inventories and drove missed sales for the quarter.
despite these challenges, premier protein net sales grew 18.2%, primarily driven by rtd shake distribution gains and strong velocities. net sales outpaced volume growth, reflecting price increases taken to offset milk protein and freight inflation, and favorable product mix. dymatize net sales grew 41%, driven by strong distribution gains and velocities. domestically, the brand was up 31%, growing in all channels.
international was even stronger, up 67% as we lap the negative impacts of covid in the prior year. last, favorable product mix drove an improvement in average net selling prices. gross profit of 96 million increased 6.9% this quarter with an expected decrease in gross profit margin of 28.2%. as we have discussed, this decline resulted from higher input and freight costs, as well as planned promotional activity.
whey protein costs moved sharply higher this quarter, ahead of our october price increase on powders, which weighed heavily on margins. our price increase on shakes is offsetting higher milk protein costs. sg&a expenses were 38 million and, as a percentage of net sales, declined 130 basis points to 11.2%, reflecting leverage of our sg&a base. turning to full year 2021 results.
net sales of 1.2 billion grew an impressive 26.2% over the prior year with gross profit of 386.2 million, growing 14.3%. gross profit margins declined to 31%, reflecting higher input costs and planned incremental promotional activity. sg&a expenses were 167.1 million and, as a percentage of net sales, declined 200 basis points to 13.4%, despite 6.1 million in higher marketing and advertising expenses and 5.2 million of restructuring and facility closure costs related to our business realignment. adjusted ebitda increased 18.6% to 233.9 million with a margin of 18.8%.
before reviewing our outlook, i would like to make a few comments on cash flow and liquidity. we had a strong fourth quarter on cash flow, generating 80.2 million from operations and 226.1 million for the year. a decrease in inventories drove a favorable benefit in fiscal 2021, which we expect to largely reverse next year as we rebuild inventories. we have 152.6 million of cash on hand and full availability under our $200 million revolver at quarter end.
as of september 30, net debt was 457.4 million, and net leverage was 2.0 times. since the ipo, we reduced net debt by approximately $280 million. now to our outlook. we expect fiscal 2022 net sales of 1.36 billion to 1.41 billion and adjusted ebitda of 255 million to 265 million.
the midpoint of our outlook implies double-digit topline growth with adjusted ebitda margins just under 19%, both of which are in line with our long-term algorithm. sales and adjusted ebitda growth are expected to be weighted to the second half. gross margins are expected to be pressured by double-digit input cost inflation, primarily whey and milk proteins. our powder portfolio is facing significant cost headwinds as whey proteins are at historical high prices.
these inflationary pressures are expected to be offset by price increases, including a double-digit price increase on our powder portfolio effective in october. we continue to closely monitor inflation and are prepared to take further pricing actions as warranted to combat these pressures. heading into the first quarter, we expect mid-single-digit net sales growth as higher net pricing was partially offset by volume declines in rtd shakes as we start to rebuild inventory. we currently expect adjusted ebitda to modestly decline from prior year with margins improving sequentially from the fourth quarter.
compared to prior year, higher whey protein costs and logistics inefficiencies are expected to weigh on margins. finally, as previously announced, post and bellring expect the distribution of a significant majority of post ownership interest in bellring to be completed in the first calendar quarter of 2022. in connection with the distribution, we expect an increase in net debt at bellring with pro forma net leverage no greater than four times upon incurrence of new debt. more details will be provided as progress is made in implementing post's plan.
in closing, there is no doubt we are facing challenging short-term dynamics with high inflation and capacity constraints. however, the long-term fundamentals of this business are solid. the convenient nutrition category has dramatically accelerated and is at the center of health and wellness trends. premier protein and dymatize are leading mainstream brands with incredible loyalty.
current and future co-manufacturers who are looking to expand are eagerly seeking to partner with us because of our leadership position and growth trajectory. while we and our industry are facing short-term challenges, the long-term opportunity for our business has never been brighter. i will now turn it over to the operator for questions.
