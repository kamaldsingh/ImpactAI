thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from robert spingarn, credit suisse.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
hi, rob.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. just a couple of different things. first, what gives you confidence in the outlook at commercial and executive jets for you to reverse these impairments at this time, what improving trends are you seeing, and does that include increased interest in ordering aircraft?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
rob, it's antonio speaking. good question. on the reversal of impairments, assuming that we revise it on a quarterly basis. it was highly driven by the exchange rate.
the devaluation of the brazilian real, we do have a lot of cost in reals, which means we didn't change volumes. we just changed the exchange rate of the margins, which accounts for the impairment reversal, adjusted, so we didn't change the baseline.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
i see. are you seeing any evidence of something you've talked about in the past and that we saw after 9/11. are you seeing actual down gauging at your customers from the commercial narrow-bodies to the e-jets, and is this a trend that is gaining some traction?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
well, francisco speaking. thanks for the question. we believe the domestic regional month will rebound the first as it happened in the past, as i mentioned. and the airlines, we look for a more versatile, flexible and more economical suite and we do believe that our e-jets are very well positioned in that direction.
so that's why we believe we have a good chance as soon as the market pickup.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then my last question is about your inventories, either in commercial, actually in any of the segments, but do you have white tails in inventory? and if so, can you quantify?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
with regards to today, current situation, we have leased a few. we are sold out in the small jet in the executive aviation. and the mid-sized jet, we still have three or four to be sold this quarter against the minimum, and also for the commercial aviation, we have no whitetails for this timing. we do have only the carryover inventory that we are due to the postponement of deliveries to 2021.
but that is not a big amount. what you do see in our inventory, we are going to run more or less 40% of our revenue in the fourth quarter. we think we are going to strongly go down with our event in q4 due to the higher deliveries in q4. but, again, no big whitetails on the inventory.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
comment, antonio to complement its due here. so as you said, we basically have no positions available. that's the reason we are so confident in the fourth quarter and on the recovery toward year end.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you all. thank you.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
welcome.

our next question comes from myles walton, ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. maybe, antonio, on the cash performance here in the third quarter, you laid out some of the onetime items. i think the commentary last quarter was you could have been closer to breakeven even for free cash flow here in the third quarter.
so i'm just curious, what changed? what is pushed out to the right? and i guess following on rob's question, why couldn't those continue to push out to the right, realizing you haven't had any cancellations, but it seems like deferrals are more likely than not.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. myles, thanks for the question, again. the previous call, we mentioned that we are seeing, and we see a good chance to become, i would say, free cash flow breakeven the second semester second half of the year. and we are still continuing to believe.
as you could see, we have a cash burn in q3 from $567 million. and we have a scheme of some aircraft deliveries to q4. we have also several payments that had an impact in q3, will be much less in q4, and we have a huge amount of deliveries in q4. we are still confident, and we are seeing progressive improvement in our free cash flow and also cash collection plays a role and also the other measures that we are taking.
let's say, we are still confident that we will be closer to breakeven in the second semester. but again, if you ask about my expectation, in the third quarter, we could have been better, $250 million. but, again, having these onetime effects shifting this effect for q4.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
and just one point, myles, sorry, to do here. we had some plans that really skip it to the fourth quarter. but as antonio highlighted in the call, we already delivered more planes in october than the whole third quarter. so i think that shows that we are very confident to revert that now in the fourth quarter, and i would say all the levers for the fourth quarter are confirmed.
so we are not seeing risks or delays as we had. we had some plans that moved from third to -- from q3 to q4, but now they are all confirmed.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ok. so maybe an additional information, myles, super tucanos deliveries september and we delivered, but we are going to book as revenue and cash now in q4, which will also help it with equation around the $80 million. that is not prior for q3 results. again, many issues were -- happened in q3, but you should see the rebound in q4.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and francisco, maybe i can ask you, as you're repositioning the business and you want to get, obviously, the commercial business, in particular, to profit or cash breakeven at worst. what is the size -- what's the deliveries or the size of the commercial business that you're sizing the cost structure to and the workforce to?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
good question, myles. we are we have been discussing this a lot in our plans for the following years. i mean, we still see 2021 as a very challenging year. i mean, i would say not much higher than we see in this year.
but we are working in various fronts to adjust the cost structure of the company to deliver a much better performance in 2021, we would say is not much higher than 2020. and the main reason for that is commercial aviation. you see that 2021 will be still a challenging year for commercial aviation. we are preparing for that -- that scenario, but we seek an opportunity to grow, i mean, from 2022 onwards.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
do you think 2021 could be breakeven for commercial aviation?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
no. commercial aviation will still suffer in 2021, but we can -- the older units will have a much better performance next year.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
as we have seen this fiscal year. by the way, we are seeing this year. now because of myles, we are likely to have a broader portfolio, and we are seeing a good performance in investor markets for executives and defense and equipment sales, which is more or less tried to compensate for the drop in commercial aviation in reversal margins and results. but you're going to see the same picture in 2021.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks again.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
welcome.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.

our next question comes from ron epstein, bank of america.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. this is mariana perez mora on for ron today.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
hi.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
hi.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
my first question will be, could you please give us some color on the short-term capital finance cash headwind you have this quarter? and not only the color on the quarter but also how -- why are you confident that this is going to recover going into next year -- into next quarter?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. that was really a short-term timing delay. so we don't do customer finance, and we have a very short-term finance that we are transferring to the final finance agent, and so there is no risk of not reverting that. so we don't do customer time.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
and it's already confirmed for the eta in brazil, your takeoff, and everything like that.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then in general, because i understand for competitive reasons, you cannot see particular details, but has cash profitability compared to like pre-pandemic cash profitability upon delivery?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
are you talking about commercial or the whole business?
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
commercial, particularly.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
we are improving. right? we suffer with lower deliveries, especially in the first half. third quarter already started to show improvement, but the big improvement will come now in the fourth quarter. as we mentioned, in october, already better than the whole third quarter.
and we're going to have much more delivers and that will drive a big improvement in cash profitability coming from working capital reduction and also the cost adjustments that we did that francisco and antonio highlighted.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and if i may, the last one, you highlighted the improvement in business operations, have you seen some like the pickup in demand already?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
well, you mean demand for 2021 or for the following years?
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. how are your sales campaigns coming in? if you have seen any pickup for business jet demand? what's booked to deal with there?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
ok. well, i mean, executive aviation is showing a good reaction. we are, for example, in our phenom family, we are sold out for 2020. we are selling aircraft for 2021, the phenom.
so it's moving well the difference in security, we are working in different campaigns as well. and also in commercial aviation, we are working on different campaigns. so hope, this second wave of covid will not being a negative impact. on the opposite, if we announce a new vaccine, this will help a lot and the rebound of the regional and domestic flights that will help us to boost our sales in commercial aviation as well.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome.thank you.

our next question comes from cai von rumohr, cowen.
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much. so maybe you could comment on the mix of your biz jets. you've done very well, very well with the 300 and the 100. basically very, very poorly in terms of deliveries of the legacies and the praetors.
why you have that sort of extreme mix and should we expect a big pickup in those larger planes in the fourth quarter and going into next year?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
cai, thanks for the question. i mean, let's see if i understand your question, but the phenom 300 is our debt seller. i mean, the most sold aircraft in its category for the past 80 years, i would say. i mean, we are improving our sales for the praetors, the 600 now out of the 500.
and then we have specific programs, specific initiatives, in our strategic plan '21-'25 to improve the competitiveness of the phenom 100 and the praetor 500. and with those plans, we expect to capture additional market share in the four years for all the families because we do believe we have a great family with the two phenoms, 100, 300, and the two praetors, the 500 and 600.
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
just to add, francisco, now in the -- we have only two praetors in the third quarter right and 19 phenoms. so we expect a much better performance in terms of the praetors now for the fourth quarter.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
correct. thank you. we do.
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. that was essentially the question. and then going forward, because if we look at this year and last year, basically, the third quarter, very weak for -- generally weak for the larger biz jets. do you expect a more level of even spread of the large biz jets because the phenom is clearly doing well, but the large ones, where the product looks attractive, doesn't seem to be doing quite as well?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
can you hear us, cai?
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. perfectly. i don't know what that was.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there was some background noise. just allow me to answer. cai, it's a good question, for sure.
if you see the sharp tie, i showed the mid-sized guess, they are not doing well compared with the small jets. that's why we are sold out in phenom 100 and 300, and we still have some open positions for the last quarter. but i'd say, we do have company for all of them. these are going to sell in another quarter.
but let's say, we have talked about five to six aircraft on the praetors and on the others, we are sold out, and you saw the deliveries we have year-to-date 43, and we are seeing for the whole year is the mid-80s for the total 2020 is actually delivered, which shows that last quarter would be hot anyway for us, but for sure, at the mid-side jets we are suffering more and also the large jets compared with these small jets.
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. and the last question is, your gross margins have come down. what should we think about where your gross margins? what is the incremental gross margin we should think, obviously, you have different businesses? but overall, if commercial and biz jet get better, what kind of incremental margins should they yield?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
it's my point of view a normalized basis because we do not have the better mix for the fiscal year, and you see above 50% in the long run, 50% to 60% in the first year.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
and also, we have a lot of initiatives to help us to reduce the cost of goods sold of the aircraft as well to reduce the production cycles of the aircraft, and this will also help us, besides the mix that point also help us to increase the gross margin of our products.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
and one important point, we were impacted by the items this year in our gross margin, with the adjustments we are doing in our workforce is not going to happen next year even in q4. september was already -- if you asked me today, september was already positive in the earnings and cash flow. just in the month of september because the idleness is being reduced and should come to an end in q4, which is an impact on our gross margin this fiscal year.
cai von rumohr -- cowen and company -- analyst
very helpful. thanks so much.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
you're welcome, cai.

our next question comes from noah poponak, goldman sachs.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
hello, noah.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
hi, noah.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
in commercial aviation, you've mentioned that you haven't really had any cancellations. but there's clearly been a decent amount of deferral activity with the lower deliveries. can you speak to where are your customers deferring to? it sounds like if you're saying 2021 deliveries will be somewhere in the zone of similar to 2020, are they deferring to 2022, or are they deferring even further? and are they giving you new plans that you feel are relatively firm, or are they just still kind of throwing their hands up in the air and are still very uncertain as to when they're going to want the airplanes?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
no. the -- thanks for the question, noah. the majority of the deferral was between 2020 -- from 2022 onwards, especially the local airline in brazil, azul, is impacted as higher here. and we do see, as francisco mentioned, 2020 more or less in the same level of this year and picking up starting 2022 to, i would say, the mid-70s.
and again, there are the highest amounts of deferred start in 2022, '23, and '24. and again, there is no additional postponements or deferrals. we may see maybe that if the environment change, the second wave of covid, it is not going to impact we may see even customers have to anticipate something. but today, flight stable everything we discuss between march and april remains different.
also the deliveries of this year, everything we discussed which was agreed between march and april. and since then, there is no change, very stable.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
if i may just add antonio here, noah. it's in part, say that the situation is very fluid, right, given everything going on with covid. but the first moment, maybe some customers, they put a big deferral but as the situation starts to get better, they start to operate again. we are the whole time talking to the customers and discussing when exactly they are going to take a pencil.
as antonio mentioned, there could be anticipations, right, to the initial deferral that they put, so the situation could really change depending on how covid goes, especially next year.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
once again, just to allow me to complete, we have set the company for this new normal, i would say, in a lower basis in order that we are able to capture more when we get an improvement and a recovery in volumes. we are not running the company with hope. it's really feet on the ground and be conservative in the balance for next year.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and, noah, i mean, just also helping my colleagues here, i mean, this year, we have to face a combination of two bad things. right? we had a drop in our revenues because of the covid impact but combined with costs much higher than normal because of the carve-out of commercial aviation. but we have done our homework.
we have adjusted the workforce, and we have put in place a lot of initiatives to reduce costs, to reduce inventories that will help us to deliver a much better financial performance in 2021, even if we say it's not much higher than 2020.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. i appreciate all that detail on commercial. maybe kind of the same cushion on the executive.
i mean, obviously, it's fluid, it can change. but for now, would you speak to where you're planning production levels for total executive units 2021, 2022?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
so for 2021, 2022, we are still evaluating the scenario, we even changed our snlp process last month and we do see something around 90 aircraft. but again, still for it, but we see more or less a good level of 90 aircraft.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then just last one on defense. the quarterly revenues have been very volatile. i know you had the delivery restrictions, but it seems like it's been volatile even excluding that.
when does the defense business, i guess, just get back on to a more smooth trajectory quarter over quarter? and maybe just kind of walk us back through some of the bigger programmatic moving pieces that can drive growth or not in that segment on a multiyear basis?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
no. i mean -- go ahead, antonio. go ahead.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
it's the -- for sure, there are always defenses in the budget of each government that's buying aircraft's for -- and covid does have some restructuring. but i would say what we are seeing in defense, we are somewhere stable on the super tucano deliveries and also -- and the kc-390 volumes that we are operating for this year and also for next year. but we are still missing additional sales for the c-390 millennium that we are right now discussing some additional campaigns. but if you ask me what could boost the situation is really an additional sales campaign for the q2 in '19?
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
should we be thinking about defense revenues three to five years out as meaningfully higher or something relatively similar to the current level?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely higher. we have a good perspective on defense for the following years. we are working on campaigns for c-390 millennium as antonio mentioned. we also have business with the brazilian navy, brazil army.
we have announced an acquisition of a cybersecurity company business. we see opportunities in that field as well so we have a good perspective for the different -- for the following five years.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. thanks so much.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
you're welcome, noah.

our next question comes from augusto ensiki, hsbc.
augusto ensiki -- hsbc -- analyst
hi. good morning. just a quick question. and most in your financials that your -- your financial -- sorry, your financial expense increased sharply.
is that related to the paydown of the -- some of the -- some of your debt as well as the issuance of the new debt? and what would be a more normal level, if not the one this quarter? thank you.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, augusto. yes. you're right, there are some additional costs related to the new debt that we raised in the third quarter.
we also had some impacts from basically noncash fx losses, which is noncash and we also had an rvg provision. so that affected our financial expenses. i would say the normal level will be more something around $50 million per quarter. that would be our net financial expenses per quarter.

good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the audio conference call that will review embraer's third-quarter 2020 results. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and webcasted at ri.embraer.com.br. this conference call includes forward-looking statements or statements about events or circumstances which have not occurred. embraer has based these forward-looking statements largely on its current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends affecting the business and its future financial performance.
these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, among other things, general economic, political, and business conditions in brazil and in other markets where the company is present. the words believes, may, will, estimates, continues, anticipates, intends, expects, and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. embraer undertakes no obligations to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events, or other factors. in light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed on this conference call might not occur.
the company's actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. participants on today's conference call are mr. francisco gomes neto, president and ceo; mr. antonio carlos garcia, chief financial officer and procurement; and mr.
eduardo couto, director of investor relations. i would like now to turn the conference over to mr. francisco gomes neto. please go ahead, sir.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, everyone. thank you very much for participating in this conference call. i'm francisco gomes neto, president and ceo of embraer. before giving the floor to antonio garcia, our cfo, i would like to make some initial comments.
with the recent growth in the number of covid-19 cases in different parts of the world, notably in europe and in the united states, we remain focused on the health and safety of our people, assessing the situation on a daily basis at each of our units around the globe. regarding finance, our focus in the short-term remains on preserving cash through the execution of a series of measures implemented over the past few months, which i have already discussed with you during our past earning calls. in parallel, we are preparing the ground for a much better financial performance in 2021 and growth in the following years. today, i'd like to take a few minutes to focus on some of our priorities, namely a lean organization and recapture synergies and business plan updates.
next slide, please. regarding our lean organization and recapture synergies pillars, we have made every effort to maintain the know-how and competitive advantage brought by our remarkable people. but in view of the new marketing reality, it has become essential to review our workforce. and in the last quarter, we made a significant adjustment to our structure.
we analyzed these structures in teams of each area within the company with the goals of creating a leaner and more agile organization and eliminating the duplications generated by the commercial aviation carve-outs. we have already recovered synergies with the reintegration of commercial aviation and the associated services and support, and at the same time, we have retained all the skills necessary to return to growth in the coming years. a simpler and leaner organization has been prepared for properly implementing our '21-'25 strategic plan, a theme that we'll address on the next slide. while we're dedicated to managing the impacts generated by the crisis in the short term, over the past few months, we have also focused on updating our business and growth plan.
we believe that the period between now and 2025 can be divided into three phases. this year is dedicated to crisis response. starting next year, we expect that the market will start to recover with variations depending on the specific business areas and markets. and from 2022 onwards, our projects will mature and allow us to grow profitably.
regarding the embraer '21-'25 strategic plan, we have reviewed the details over the past few months, in response to the new market scenario, including the impacts generated by the pandemic, the end of the agreement with boeing, and the reintegration of commercial aviation. this was a collaborative effort involving dozens of company leaders, who focused on the plan's effectiveness and we know it is realistic. the goals are challenging, but doable, and we will execute with focus, governess, and discipline. the plan has two main objectives: to increase your revenue and to improve profitability.
to achieve these two objectives, we define these three lines of action. number one, initiatives aimed at efficiency gains; number two, actions to increase the sales of our current product portfolio; and number three, a combination of business diversification projects, innovation, and strategic partnerships. in total, the plan comprises 18 projects that will bring you more agility and intelligence to the processes and reinforce alignment across the company. just to give you a little more visibility, the first front which is related to efficient gains entails the creation of a world-class purchasing organization, reporting to the cfo, and focusing in a very structured way on intelligent cost reduction.
at the same time, we're incorporating more intelligence into the processes within the material planning and logistics area, focusing on increasing eventual return to reduce substantially working capital. in operations, the process aims to reduce aircraft production cycles, which will allow us to have more competitive products and reduce the working capital as well. regarding the second front, dedicated to the growth of portfolio sales, we'll intensify the sales efforts of our products, the benefit from new and competitive products in every segment in which we operate. additionally, we'll focus on adapting and converting aircraft for specific segments, such as converting e-jet to carry cargo into the passenger cabin, or the recently launched phenom 300 med, which was designed for medical evacuation.
finally, on the diversification, innovation, and partnerships front, we're going to expand our operations. this year, we have already announced investments in cybersecurity with the acquisition of tempest, the frigate project with the brazilian navy, and more recently, the creation of ev, a company dedicated to the development of the urban air mobility ecosystem and evtol, electrical vertical landing and take-off aircraft. from this front, we are also developing projects to expand our service offerings for aircraft from other manufacturers. and we're discussing potential strategic partnerships aimed at opening new markets and developing new products such as the turboprop.
it's important to note that, in addition to managing where we structure the project, the plan focused on the process of execution and on the constant monitoring of the evolution of all initiatives. we're aware of the challenge we have ahead, especially in commercial aviation in 2021, but we're very confident in the future of embraer. we know what must be done. we know how the plan should be carried out, and we have an immensely competent and aligned team that will develop the necessary initiatives to make the company grow profitably in the coming years.
with that, i have concluded my comments and i would like to give the floor to our cfo, antonio garcia. over to you, antonio. thank you all. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, francisco. good morning, everyone. it's really a great pleasure to talk to all of you. now moving to the commercial aviation highlights on slide 7.
during the third quarter, we delivered seven e-jets, representing a sequential improvement compared to the first and second quarters that we will accelerate even more in the fourth quarter. among our third-quarter deliveries, we had 5, 175s for united airlines, highlighting our continuous leadership in u.s. regional jet market. as another example of our continuous improvement, have already delivered more plans in october than in the entire third quarter of 2020.
as far as new operators, all airlines from australia received 14 pre-owned e190s and bamboo airways from vietnam, we start-up operation with two e195. we are still not in the point where we can give guidance on expected deliveries or financial performance due to the covid-19 uncertainties. but we would like to point out that we remain cautiously optimistic for the future as we have seen a gradual rebound in domestic flight activities in several markets around the world, including the united states. looking at commercial aviation in 2021, the uncertainty around the covid pandemic is still our biggest concern for next year.
the fleet of 175 in operations continues to improve with 93% in service as of the end of september, outpacing our competitors in the market. i'm also proud to say that we had zero cancellation of commercial jet orders since the beginning of the covid pandemic. the active debts on slide 8. we had a strong delivery pickup during the third quarter with 21 deliveries.
this brought the total executive debts delivered so far in 2020 to 43 aircraft. we expect the fourth quarter to remain strong forever, and deliveries should continue to increase compared to the previous quarter. as a result of higher deliveries, improved mix, and measures taking to be more cost-efficient, the executive debt segment posted positive operating margins in the third quarter and year to date. marking, the continuous turnaround of our profitability on this segment despite the covid-19 pandemic.
also, as mentioned in the last call, we launched the phenom 300 med during the third quarter, which is a unique mid rack solution that's also available for hetero pits on existing phenom 300s. in terms of new technology, embraer continues to disrupt the media segment with praetors, hepa filters, now being standard while lavatory electrical doors and synthetic vision systems were both certified during the quarter. finally, we would like to highlight the continued recovery during the third quarter, in particular with respect of the fractional and charter operation, with the smaller and medium jets. among fractional images activities were down only 13% year over year, comparing to the media debts down to 18% and larger jets 33%.
among charters, the jet activities were almost flat versus last year. while the medium and larger debt class were down 5% to 70%, respectively. as you can see, the max where labor is positioned with the phenoms praetor is recovering faster. moving to slide 9, we showed the highlights of defense and security.
we regarded the c-390 millennial program. we are currently six c390 in various stages of production for future deliveries to brazil and portugal, and we expect to deliver one more aircraft to the brazil air force still this year. the program also received the 2020 grand laureate awards for defense from the aviation week, which selects the best aircraft program, black horse, commercial executive defense around the world. another highlight during the quarter was the super tucano as embraer was able to deliver 10 planes to international customers.
with the reopening of global borders, we were able to deliver super tucanos to nigeria, chile, and the philippines. finally, the first grip and e1 arrived in brazil to start its flight test company, which is a major milestone in the brazilian jet fighter program with saab. embraer, we all also play a leading role in the execution of the program in brazil. and we'll be responsible for the systems development, integration, flight testing, and final sale and delivery of the aircraft to the brazilian air force.
now turning to services and support on slide 10. we are proud to say that embraer, once again, was ranked first in pro-pilot's corporate aircraft process support survey in 2020, underlining our commitment to customers to provide the best after-sales support possible. our services and support team also completed the seven conversion of a legacy 450 to praetor 500 since this service became available early this year. we were also able to get the certification in the third quarter of the first e-jets modified for cargo transportation in cabins, offering our customers a solution to better utilize their fleets in the environment of lower passenger traffic caused by the covid-19 pandemic.
further in servicing, we are pleased to see that the kc-390 millennial has been showing excellent reliability in the humanitarian missions in brazil and abroad. moving on to our financial results on slide 12. our backlog finished the third quarter at $15.1 billion, representing several years of revenue for embraer. it is important to highlight again that despite some deferrals, we didn't have any cancellation in commercial aviation.
and we expect some new sales to potentially lead to a backlog expansion in the upcoming quarters, depending on the impacts of a second covid wave in certain regions. on slide 13, we show revenues and deliveries. we can clearly see an improvement in the third quarter relative to what we had in the first and half of the year and the impacts of covid on the industry start to reduce with a higher commercial and executive jets delivered in the quarter. as i mentioned earlier, we expect an even better fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.
we also had a strong revenue improvement in defense and security, following the reopening of international borders to allow for the deliveries of super tucanos. our services and support business, despite a year-over-year decline due to the covid-19, has also increased double digits sequentially from the second quarter with transportation improved activities across the commercial jets in the defense markets. next, on slide 14, embraer highlights its continued cost control and selling and unrestrictive expenses. the reduction of sg&a reflects our ongoing efficiency structure actions, as already mentioned earlier in this presentation combined, of course, lower marketing expenses coming from the covid-19 restructuring.
it is important to mention that selling expenses include higher bad debt provisions compared to last year, mostly related to our services and support receivables. excluding the bad debt provision, sg&a expenses on a year-to-date basis in 2020 are 30% lower than the same period of 2019. on slide 15, we show our operating results. embraer reported adjusted ebit of a loss of $45 million in the third quarter with a margin of minus 6%.
the adjusted ebit in the third quarter excluded a positive impact of $7 million from special items, including $54 million in charge related to our restructuring announced in september and $30 million in additional bad debt provision, offset by $75 million deposits new reveres of noncash impairments charged in executive and commercial aviation. breaking our third-quarter margin by business, executive jets was positive 2%; services and support, 4% positive; defense and security breakeven, similar to the previous quarter. commercial aviation was response for the negative operating results due to the low deliveries and the cost impacts. so slide 16 shows our adjusted ebitda, which was a loss of $80 million and also excluded the special items already mentioned in the previous slide.
adjusted ebit margin was minus 1%. the combination of better volumes and cost cut initiatives have already started to appear in the third quarter. and we expect this trend to accelerate in the fourth quarter of the year. moving to next on slide 17, with earnings.
embraer adjusted net income reached a loss of $148 million in the third quarter. our earnings have been negatively impacted by the lower operating results as well as higher financial expenses and noncash fx losses, similar to the operating numbers. net income also reached a bottom in the second quarter and has started to rebound, and we expect better bottom-line performance in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by higher deliveries. next slide, slide 18.
we show embraer's total investment over the last few quarters. the company has launched several initiatives to cut investment, including capex as well as research and development. this reflects our actions to preserve cash. it also highlights in rare updated portfolio with state-of-art products in commercial aviation, executive jets, defense, and security.
embraer has invested a lot in the last five years, bringing new programs and products to the market. and now we expect that upcoming years to show lower investments. total investment during the third quarter reached $45 million and $134 million year to date, which is less than half of our investment level of 2019. moving to slide 19.
our free cash flow was usage of $567 million in the third quarter. this free cash flow usage was negatively impacted by approximately $250 million, including three major items: first, one-off charge of around $70 million related to the restructuring and severance cost package of our red headcount reduction in the beginning of september; second, around $100 million in short-term customer finance that will be normalized now in the fourth quarter; and third, another $80 million related to three plants that skipped from the end of the third quarter to the fourth quarter. excluding that, our cash consumption in the third quarter of this year will be very close to the third quarter of 2019. giving expectations for higher deliveries in the fourth quarter, we had a positive impact on our working capital as well as our cost reduction initiatives.
we are confident that our free cash flow will be much better in the first quarter of the year, and we should be at least a cash breakeven in the second half of 2020. finally, on slide 20, we highlight our strong cash position. our liquidity increased during the third quarter with a total cash position of $2.2 billion, which is a similar cash level that would have prior to the covid pandemic. i'm also happy to announce that we completed a series of liability management initiatives.
new loans with private and public banks as well new bond issuance of $750 million, maturing in 2028, and as the repurchase of $250 million of outstanding in 2022 and '23 bonds. it's important to highlight that our new 2020 rate bonds is unsecured and had a market demand above $3 billion, showing the confidence of a divestor in the long term of embraer. with that, i conclude my presentation and we can open for questions. thank you very much.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from myles walton, ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. i was hoping that you could perhaps touch on new products. and you mentioned franciso and antonio about revenue growth and partnerships that would be required for really investing on new products.
and i wonder if you could comment around both the turboprop area as well as evtol area. how much embraer is willing to spend to create those markets versus what they need from partners and when those partnerships might materialize?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, myles. francisco speaking. thanks for the question. well, let's separate this, answering in two parts.
first, i mean, we do have a very new and competitive portfolio of products, right, that we have considered in our five-year strategic plan. now, the e2 family that we're still working in the e175-e2, the phenoms, the praetors in executive aviation, in the new c-390 millennium in the defense. for new products, like the turboprop, like the south, that we are working in different partnerships -- strategic partnerships. for the south, for example, we are working.
we are close to get a contract from the brazilian air force. and for the turboprop, we are working in this partnership front to find a partner to help us to fund and accelerate the development of the product and to open new markets for the product as well. so, this is what we are doing. we are -- i would say that we are in an advanced stage in such fronts, but we don't have anything concrete yet to share with you.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. very good. and one other one, if i could. the profitability that you think the company can get to in your vision '21 to '25, should we think about the ebitda margins of embraer over the past in the mid-teens, 14, 16%? is that where you're trying to get to? or do you think you can have a pathway to get above those margins?
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
thanks, myles, antonio speaking here. we are going to tell you around the ebit margin first. we do believe we are -- with everything we have in front of us, being able to reach higher single-digit ebit margin throughout this five-year plan, which leads us automatic for the ebitda that you had just mentioned.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
very good. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from robert spingarn, credit suisse.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. i got a couple of questions. but first, just a follow-up to what myles just asked you.
on urban mobility, would you seek a strategic partner there either for the aircraft side or for the air taxi side or might you access the public markets? and i'm specifically asking about eve accessing the public markets as a separate company?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, rob, for the question. as i said in my introduction -- in my closing remarks i'd say, we continue to invest in innovation programs and projects. and it is one of the most important ones that we are working at this moment.
we see a great potential in that market, no doubt for the vehicle itself, the evtol, but also for the urban air mobility traffic management as well. and we continue -- we are working to exploring potential investors and also strategic opportunities. but we don't have also anything concrete to share with you at this point of time. but this is in terms of innovation, one of our most important initiatives, no doubt.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then, turning to the competitive environment. in the regional jet business, we've had a fairly significant change with bombardier and mitsubishi essentially dropping out of the new aircraft production market. so, now, really, in rjs or at least up to 110 seats, it's only embraer.
to what extent does this change the market dynamics for you? and are you seeing any evidence of traditional bombardier operators now looking at embraer e-jets for growth or replacement aircraft?
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
rob, it's antonio --
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
go ahead, antonio.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
it's antonio speaking here. for sure, we do -- i do believe what's -- with the two competitors not putting aircraft to compete with us, didn't change too much because we were the market leader anyway. we just see a v-shape recovery very strong in u.s. for the regional jets, where we are almost done 75 e1.
i would say didn't change it much because from the 24, four aircraft we delivered 2020. two-thirds was already for the regional jets in u.s., and we just continue to fulfill our customer demands. for the new operators or new -- the other airlines to take decision to rightsize their fleets, we do believe it's going to take more time to take a decision, say, ok, now we go to buy 175-e2, i want or even now our e2s. we do believe this rightsize or change in the fleet profile is going to take two or three years, in our opinion.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
and if you allow me to complement, antonio, the e2 is the most economical, i mean, aircraft -- one single aisle aircraft in the market, the most efficient one. it offers -- i mean, a reduction of about 20% in the cost per shift comparing to the big narrow bodies, the competition. so, we are very well positioned, either with the new ones, as antonio said, or with the new e2s.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
do you see any chance to get the e2-175 into the u.s. market?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
well, go ahead.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
robert, we do believe the scope clause is still resisting to '25 and '26. we are monitoring this, yes. and we are concluding the development certification of the aircraft in 2023.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
'23.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
and we do have other guys outside the u.s. for this product or the customers. but until 2025, i will not make any forecast right now. that scope clause is not going to play a role in u.s.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and just a last question, a clarification with regard to the long-term forecast on slide 22. when you say recovery in 2021 and then growth beyond, is that specific? i mean, do you see 2019-type numbers in 2021, at least in any area, regional jets, bizjets or cash flows? or is that really going to come after '21?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
well, we see 2021 still as a challenging year. and -- but i think we did our homework in 2020. we rightsized the organization. we put in place a lot of initiatives to improve our efficiency to sell more.
and we don't see a big growth in 2021 in terms of revenues, mainly because of the commercial aviation that are still strongly impacted by the covid. but our other business units, they are much more resilient, as we said before. the executive aviation had its best year ever in 2020. despite of the covid, we see a very good year for the executive aviation in 2021 and the same for the defense and services.
in the commercial aviation, we expect to see some growth from '22 onwards. but to be back to pre-covid levels, we believe that this will be from 2023 and beyond.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
and when in there, would you expect cash flow breakeven?
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
rob, i don't want to give you a guidance, but we are fighting for the best already in 2021, but we are evaluating here before i give a guidance to the market. 2021 will be still a challenging year for us. for sure, free cash flow will be much better than 2020, no question mark, but we are still evaluating to give you guys a better guidance for this year.
robert spingarn -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you both very much. very helpful. thank you.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
you're very welcome.
operator
our next question comes from mariana perez mora, bank of america.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good afternoon everyone. hello. so, my first question is also a follow-up on this. could you please give us some color on the strategic, i mean the strategy about spinning off if last year, is it because of operations, is it because of like attracting investors? and if you can give any color on -- if you were to see that company come public, how can that be?
eduardo couto -- director of investor relations
mariana, it's eduardo here. i'll take that one. as we said, we created eve at the end of last year. as francisco mentioned, we believe a lot on the urban air mobility market.
it's a exponential growth market. and we are really, i would say, excited about that opportunity. and that was the reason behind the eve creation itself. we're exploring potential investors and strategic opportunities.
but we are not commenting at any specific alternative or any structure at this point. so, that's pretty much what we can say.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and then, the other one is on executive. if i'm not wrong, your margins this quarter were close to 13%. and is it first time you have or you're seeing double digits since 2014? how sustainable is that kind of margins? how should we think about margins going forward?
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
so i do -- we do see the -- we are trying to follow a structure in the executive aviation, which has tried to build so many aircraft as we can so, we can deliver, first one. we finished 2020 without any whitetails in the inventory, first one. second one, we are seeing a recovery. even that last year, we delivered much less than 2019.
in a sustainable way, we do see the executive aviation always in the higher single-digit ebit margin for the longer run. and for sure, we still have issues to work in our product portfolio in order to improve market share and be more aggressive, some of the other initiatives in -- regarding to products, but we are well placed. we are, in the light jets, the market leader. and we are proud of, i would say, sustainable -- i would say, mid- to higher single-digit ebit margin from the longer run.
and mariana, it's important, and when we mention about the ebit margin is without services. it's just pure aircraft. if you compare it with the peers, some peers, they show the ebit margin with services. we are just talking about pure sales and deliveries of aircraft.
and that shows that embraer is not only commercial aviation, it's also executive aviation, which has a lot of value to deliver.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect. and if i may, last one from me on leverage. how should we think about this balance sheet structure and trends in the near term?
eduardo couto -- director of investor relations
yes. we had a very strong fourth quarter, right, mariana, in terms of cash generation. we generated north of $700 million in cash. that was very important to deleverage the company.
we ended the year with a very strong cash, $2.8 billion in cash, net debt around 1.7%. the company's highly focused, as francisco mentioned many times and antonio, to generate cash, to continue to deleverage, also, any new or heavy investments will need to come with partnerships, also to reduce the investment effort from embraer, which will also be important to generate cash. so we are confident that we are on the right path. and we expect free cash flow to improve meaningfully this year already and for the years to follow so that we generate cash and can deleverage the company.
so, we are not comfortable with the leverage we are today, ok?
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from marcelo motta, j.p. morgan.
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi everyone. good afternoon. two questions from my side as well. the first is regarding the sales campaign, right? you virtually commented during the presentation that you do expect to have some results in the short term.
so, just wondering how much more can you mention about it. and also, if we look at the backlog of the company, i mean, do you think it could go back to levels pre-covid if thing going to be a more short-term type of backlog as companies is still working on the order. so, how can we think about those two lines?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, marcelo, for your question. but i think i would answer in different ways, i'd say. for commercial aviation, yes, we have -- we are working on a lot of campaigns. i mean, for e1s, especially in the u.s.
and for e2s in different markets. but the written, to close those deals really depending on the vaccination progress. many companies, they are expecting a growth in their market airlines, but this covid impact is still an issue for them. on the other side, i mean, executive aviation, we are doing pretty well.
we started very strongly this year with new orders, much better than in the past. and defense, we are very stable this year as we were last year. so, it's a very resilient business that we have. in the service area, this is approaching the pre-covid levels.
so, again, i think that for executive, defense and service, we are doing pretty well in terms of orders. but in the commercial, it really depends on the progress of the vaccination in the different parts of the world.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
so in regard to -- marcelo, it's antonio speaking here. in regard to our backlog, we take a look backwards and between 10 to 15 billion, 40 billion is i would say, it's not a risk for embraer. we are, i would say, safe for the years beyond. there is a cancellation -- having no cancellation is really key for us means we have our customers supporting us.
the reduction itself is clearly, we delivered a lot in 2020, and we were not able to close too many deals. and you know better covid one -- wave one, wave two, see what's happening in brazil here. the specialty airlines, they are reluctant to take fast decision as long there is no visibility for the impact of the covid. but i would say, we should be able to be minimally stable this year with the new campaigns that we are discussing right now.
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
you're welcome.

our next question comes from noah poponak, goldman sachs.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
how are you seeing commercial production or unit deliveries for 2021 versus 2020?
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
noah, it's antonio speaking. we see a slightly better than 2021, not a big spike, but it's slightly better in regard to units.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i guess, i respect that a lot of the companies in the industry aren't providing guidance. and we're also working through a pandemic. so, there's just general high levels of uncertainty.
but, i guess, i'm a little surprised you're not providing guidance because if you're speaking to regional jet deliveries up a little bit. business jet, it seems even a little firmer than that. you have the phenom 300 as your highest unit airplane, which is a really well positioned airplane. and then defense was flat this year and is a little more insulated.
and then, margins and cash flow are in your control beyond top line. is there something else besides just the broader umbrella of uncertainty that i'm missing in that that's holding you back from providing an outlook for the year?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
no, i would say -- noah, thank you for the questions, really a great question. but we -- from the operational side, we are leaving in crazy times in brazil. we all know about this. we do not expect issue in our operations, but you never know what can happen, but it's one point.
and the second point, we are just evaluating our free cash flow in a better way in order to be more precise. we -- the issue for us this is improving free cash flow, and we are reluctant to give a guidance right now in order to -- we don't want to disappoint the market before we have clear idea what's going to happen. this year, there are a lot of moving parts, especially the sales campaign that could change a lot of this number that we are going to provide to you. that's why we prefer to keep our horses here for more one or two quarters.
sorry for saying this, but it's the reality.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
no, no. no. that's fair and sensible. i just wanted to -- yes, i just wanted to ask that.
last one, your answer to myles' question on future margins was a little surprising to me where he was making the point that the company used to have a mid-teens ebitda margin. and your answer to him was you were looking at and thinking about high single-digit ebitda margins in 2025. the company has had dna that's pretty consistently been kind of 5% of revenue outside of 2020 where the revenues are depressed. so that would mean that you're thinking ebit margins sub-5%.
that's just surprisingly low compared to where you've been historically, what some of your targets have been over time? yes, am i missing noting something there?
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
no, no, no, just to correct. it was comments in regard to the ebit margin, not the ebitda. we do see higher single-digit ebit margin for this period. and we are there already.
if you see executive, we closed with 8%. in defense, we have 6%. and now say we're to be much better. i was mentioning in regard to ebit margin.
and for sure, the ebitda margin will be double-digit anyway because we're going back.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i'm glad i asked for the clarification. then i started -- heard the acronym, you were all speaking to incorrectly. ok.
understood. and yeah, thanks for the time.

francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon to all and thank you for joining us in our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 results presentation. i hope that all of you are well and safe. and i thank you for your interest in our company and most of all in the confidence in our future. i will start with a short introduction about last year.
and afterwards, our cfo, antonio, will go into more details on the numbers for 2020 and the fourth quarter. i will return at the end of the presentation to speak a bit more about our main initiatives and my vision of the future. our challenges in 2020 were not just limited to the covid-19 pandemic crisis. we also had to deal with the termination of the strategic partnership with boeing in commercial aviation.
this and other challenges negatively impacted our revenues and costs throughout 2020, directly affecting the results of the company. that said, we reacted quickly to adapt to the new reality in a integrated and structured way, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, supporting our society with several initiatives to combat the pandemic, and we also focused on cash preservation. faced with this new reality, we adjusted our workforce to create a leaner and rightsized the organization. we are now more agile to progress with efficient gains with sales campaigns and with strategic partnerships.
during this process, we also recovered the synergies with the reintegration of the commercial aviation business and its related services. finally, we created a new business plan, known as embraer strategic plan '21/'25, which will be our guide for the next several years to return to grow in a profitable and sustainable way, resulting in embraer becoming more profitable than it was in the past. before i go into more details regarding the '21/'25 initiatives, we will discuss the 2020 results. i will now hand it over to antonio, and i will return in the end.
thank you. 
antonio carlos garcia -- chief financial officer and procurement
thank you, francisco. 2020 was my first year at embraer and a very challenging and unprecedented year for the company, but i'm very happy with our achievements that we had, which i will show in more detail in the upcoming slides. the embraer team is impressive, and i'm convinced that embraer is on the right path. now, moving to the financial highlights on slide five.
the covid impact was felt much more in commercial aviation. our consolidated revenue declined around 30% in 2020. and commercial aviation and its related services responded for more than 8% of this decline. during the year, we made a great progress in integrating commercial aviation within embraer, and all of our business units are now moving forward with a united focus on improving results as we gradually emerge from the pandemic.
we have a resilient backlog with strong customer and partners to build on. and we are proud to say that none of our commercial customers canceled any of their orders during 2020. we, in fact, are cautiously optimistic in signing new orders in commercial aviation during 2021. the executive aviation and defense businesses showed encouraging performance during the year, with a strong profitability improvement as we continue to work on this business to generate consistent margin going forward.
the record margins in executive jets proves that we are in the right way. we changed the company mindset to implement the actions to reduce cash outflows, expenses and optimizing investments, sg&a in 2020 without compromising any of our ongoing projects or operating capabilities of the business. besides that, the rightsize we announced in the third quarter has been implemented, and we expect a tailwind from that in 2021 results. we continue to work on reducing our working capital needs to unlock cash in our business, particularly with respect to inventories and accounts payables.
as we highlighted in the second quarter and again reiterated in the third quarter of last year, we finished 2020 with a very strong cash generation, which was ahead of our expectation of breakeven cash in the second part of the year. we are also able to improve our liquidity during the last -- difficult time last year, securing more than a billion in finance from different sources, such as bndes, u.s. exim private and public banks as well from the debt capital market with long-term bonds, finished the year with a very strong liquidity of $2.8 billion in cash. it's important to note that due to the uncertainties related to the pandemic and its impact on our business, we are not announcing financial guidance for 2021 this time.
we will continue to evaluate the possibility of releasing 2021 guidance as the year progresses. so, moving to the highlights for our commercial aviation business on slide six. deliveries recovered nicely in the fourth quarter, with 28 jets delivered in the period and a total of 44 aircraft delivered during 2020. this also included the milestone of the e-jets number 1,600 delivers to helvetic airways.
we also had delivered to important and longtime customers in 2020, including the aercap, air france, america airlines, asu, united airlines and others. we had zero firm order cancellation since the start of the pandemic, a fact that we are very proud of, which illustrates a less speculative nature of our backlog compared to peers. despite some new covid outbreaks in several regions of the world and at the end of 2020 and early 2021, had delayed some sales campaign, but we are confident that we will announce important new orders in short term and throughout 2021. our commercial aircraft continue to lead the recovery of domestic flights in several markets around the world and airlines recognized the economics and the environmental value of our best-in-class jets in the 750 seats category.
we see strong market demand for e-jets around the world. and last year lessors placed up to 90 used e-jets in the market, and we added six new e-jets operators during the pandemic. now, shifting to executive aviation highlights on slide seven. embraer delivered 43 executive jets in the fourth quarter, leading to a total of 86 jets delivered in 2020, with no whitetail carryover into 2021.
as far as profitability, 2020 was really a great year for embraer's executive jets, as represented strong margins of high-single digits and cash generation with a solid backlog and improving sales. in terms of client recognition, the phenom 300 was the best-selling light jet again in 2020, the ninth consecutive year. and last year, the phenom 300 was not only the best-selling light jet but also the best-selling twin-engine jet in the entire executive aviation industry. we also reached an important milestone of the first praetor 600 jet delivered to the fleet launch operator, flexjet, in 2020.
a very important customer that has chosen phenoms and praetors to expand its business in a multiyear deal that was signed in 2019. i would also like to highlight that the pandemic recovery is on its way in the executive aviation, as business jet operation are already back to over 90% of pre-pandemic levels with a strong momentum in 2021 for embraer. so, on slide eight, we go into some highlights for our defense and security business. during the year, we signed a contract with the brazilian navy as part of a consortium with thyssenkrupp to build four ships, with deliveries expected to happen between 2025 and 2028.
this underscores our positioning as the true defense house of brazil. we were also very happy to announce the sales of two c-390 millennium cargo transport and tanker aircraft to hungary, closing our second export customer of these aircraft after portugal. we also delivered two c-390 aircraft to the brazil air force in 2020 and 16 a-29 super tucanos to the clients around the world during the period. we also continue to work in 2020 with brazilian air force to study development of a new light cargo aircraft with short takeoff and landing capabilities.
in terms of profitability, defense and security was our most resilient business during the pandemic, as revenue grew, and our operating margin moved from the negative in 2019 to a mid-single-digit positive in 2020. slide no. 9 with respect to our services and support business highlights. let me first say that the business was significantly impacted in the early days of the pandemic as most commercial and business jet worldwide were stopping.
but since then, services and support has shown an impressive and consistent improvement during 2020. the business continued to perform despite the impact of the pandemic, completing 11 conversion of a legacy 450 to new praetor 500 jets during the year. also, services and support helped and supported our commercial airline customers to adapt the realities imposed by the pandemic, working to get e-jets modify and certified for a cargo transportation cabins. for the long term, we are proud that our ogma mro business in portugal was selected to become a new pratt & whitney authorized maintenance center for gtf engines in europe.
after some initial investment in the business, we are excited for the growth opportunity for ogma to potentially triple in size in the next several years. finally, we are optimistic for the future as we finish 2020 with services and support activities approaching pre-pandemic levels. now, let's go into more details on the quarterly and yearly financial results. on slide 11, we show our year-end backlog, which finished 2020 at $14.4 billion and declined mainly due to the impact of the pandemic on new orders, particularly in commercial aviation.
our total backlog fell around 15% in 2020, which compares favorably with our peers that face larger cancellations. it also highlights our high-quality customer backlog with a very little speculative order. we are also cautiously optimistic regarding better order environment across all of our business in 2021. on slide 12, we turn to aircraft deliveries, which showed a strong recovery in the new normal levels in the fourth quarter.
we delivered a total of 44 commercial aircraft in the year, with more than half coming in the fourth quarter and delivered a total of 86 executive jets in 2020, of which half came from the fourth quarter. the annual deliveries in commercial aviation were clearly impacted by the pandemic, while executive aviation deliveries were less affected. so moving to net revenue on slide 13. embraer reported just under $3.80 billion in revenue for 2020, which was a 30% decline compared with 2019.
as mentioned previously, decline in commercial aviation and its related service were responsible for more than 80% of these reductions. looking at the geographic split of our 2020 revenues performance of north america and european market has a direct impact on our business, as just over 80% of our 2020 revenues came in from this region. continued improvement on covid cases, vaccine rollouts and eventually, improvements on passenger traffic, give us optimism for the future. in slide 14, embraer presented a significant cost control during the year of 2020 as part of its cultural transformation, as clearly shown on slide 14.
our total sg&a declined almost 30% in 2020 as compared to 2019, excluding a bad debt provision of 62 million in 2020. this reduction is impressive and hardly in line with decline in sales for the year, despite a large part of the sg&a expenses being fixed cost in nature. so regarding adjusted ebit in slide 15. embraer had a solid fourth quarter with one of the best levels of consolidated margin in recent years at 4.2% positive.
this reflects not only the improvement in commercial and executive deliveries in the quarter, but also the improvements in defense and security and services and support pipelines as well the benefits of cost control and the initial positive impacts of our restructuring actions taken in september. adjusted ebit in the fourth quarter excludes a total of $27 million of positive net impacts coming from restructuring expenses impairments and bad debt provisions. for the full year, we finished with adjusted ebit of a loss of $101 million, representing an adjusted ebit margin of minus 2.7%. this compares favorably with last year breakeven level, despite a more than 30% decline in revenues caused largely by the covid-19 pandemic.
we expect higher profitability levels in the future years as we continue to recover top line growth and cost reduction initiatives are mostly permanent. for 2020, the adjusted ebit margin by segment was minus 7% at commercial, plus 8% at executives, plus 6% defense and 4% services and support through moving items and one-off impacts. slide 16 shows our adjusted ebitda, which was positive 146 million in the fourth quarter and also excluding the special items already mentioned in the previous slide. adjusted ebitda margin for the fourth quarter was 7.9%.
for 2020, despite the significant impact that the pandemic had in our business and with revenue dropping 30%, embraer generated a positive adjusted ebitda of $82 million for the year with an adjusted ebitda margin of 2.2%, which was very close to 2019 levels, despite a meaningful decline in revenues. on slide 17, we turn to the adjusted net income, which for the fourth quarter was a loss of 30 million and was better than the adjusted net loss of 93 million in the last year for the fourth quarter, despite lower revenue in the period. for the full year, embraer reported adjusted net loss of 464 million, which was higher than 2019, driven by the lower operating income as well, higher financial expenses. we believe that higher profitability in the coming years, combined with lower financial expenses as we continue to recover the top line and improve our cash position, will be important drivers for embraer earnings rebound in the years ahead.
another lever we pulled during 2020 to reduce cash outflow was reduction of capex and development spending that we show in slide 18. the total investment declined 60% to 203 million. thought it's very important to note that none of our ongoing products has been compromised in terms of timing. we are nearing the end of the development cycle for the c-390 millennium, the e175-e2 development continues to progress as expected, and we continue to invest in our executive aviation segment to maintain the competitiveness with the state-of-the-art products.
as we look to the future, investment is likely to increase a little bit from 2020 levels, but not in a significant way as our product portfolio is new and any large investment will require strategic partners. we are also highly focused on improving free cash flow generation in the coming years. so, on slide 19, we show the company's free cash flow in 2019 and '20. we finished the year with a free cash flow usage of 990 million.
but i'd like to highlight the strong cash generation in the fourth quarter of 725 million, which almost equalized the last year recorded free cash flow generation. also, we promised to the market that the second half of the year would be breakeven free cash flow. and we actually beat that by generating almost 160 million of free cash flow in the second half. cost control, improvements in deliveries and more efficient use of working capital are all helped in the cash flow increase for the fourth quarter.
we continue to work to deliver meaningful free cash flow improvements in 2021 versus 2020, as we gain further traction in our working capital initiatives as well additional cost efficient in some revenue gains. finally, on slide 20, we show the company's strong liquidity position. as embraer finished the year with nearly 2.8 billion in cash, much improvement from the previous quarter and similar to 2019 levels, we were successfully getting additional liquidity during 2020 via different finance sources. we have less than 10% of our debt coming due in the next 12 months, and the average maturity of our debt is above four years.
with that, i will now turn the call over to franciso for his closing remarks. thank you.
francisco gomes neto -- president and chief executive officer
as you could see from antonio's presentation, the pandemic has meaningfully impacted the results of our business. but the fourth-quarter results are a clear example that we are making significant progress in our financial performance. the numbers reflect not only the actions implemented as a response to the crisis but also the beginning of the execution of our strategic plan. 2021 will still be a challenging year as the crisis has not ended yet and the scenario remains uncertain and volatile.
but despite all of the uncertainty, we are confident that this will be a year of recovery in our main markets to get back to stronger growth from 2022 onwards. with respect to our '21/'25 plan, i would like to highlight a few points. our strategy for the next five years has two main objectives: grow revenues and improve profitability. to do this, we must work as much on the top line to increase revenues as on the bottom line to reduce costs and improve margins.
we will achieve these objectives, focusing on the following fronts. revenue growth of our current portfolio of products in all business units on projects to bring efficient gains and our initiatives for innovation, diversification and strategic partnerships. some of the actions of the business plan are already progressing and have started to show results, such as on the sales front. in commercial aviation, it is market consensus that the sector's recovery will begin first with regional aviation.
and the e2 family of jets is the best solution for customers that need to make their fleets more flexible, economical and efficient. this is in addition to a strong and continuous demand for e1 jets, principally in the u.s. market. we have various sales campaigns ongoing and the advance in vaccinations in different regions of the world will be a crucial factor in closing these new opportunities.
executive aviation in 2020 had its best performance ever with stronger profitability and cash generation, despite the challenges of the pandemic and starts 2021 even better with strong sales. the defense business remains resilient with good growth prospects and improvement in profitability. as we continue to ramp up the learning curve and maturity of our multi-mission transport aircraft, the c-390 millennium and expanded the pipelining of sales campaigns for this aircraft and for the super tucano as well. overall, across our businesses, we had one of the newest portfolios of products in their respective industries with the e2s, the phenoms, the praetors and the c-390.
they are state-of-the-art, technologically disruptive and highly capable products that are the result of the last several years of investments that we have made. these products should help us to grow much faster than overall market levels as we emerged from the pandemic. the services and support area is already approaching pre-pandemic levels and continues a rapid recovery with good financial performance. the 25-year multibillion-dollar contract signed between ogma and pratt & whitney for engine maintenance in portugal will triple the subsidiaries revenues in the next several years.
this translates to revenue and profitability growth for embraer. on efficiency gains, already in the second half of 2020, we started to see significant improvements in inventory levels, reduction in the production cycles of our aircraft and components and cost reductions in general. in addition, we continue to focus on maintaining our innovation dna. we announced the creation of eve, a business dedicated to the development of the advanced air mobility ecosystem.
in the evtol, in electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, a segment with strong growth potential in the years to come. and we also remained focused on the discussion of strategic partnerships to open new markets, among others, for our commercial jets, our multi-mission aircraft, the c-390 on development of the new turboprop project and on growth in our services and support business. i know that many of you have invested in and have for the embraer for a long time and know our company very well. for that reason, i think it's important that you leave this presentation with a clear understanding regarding five key points.
first, this is a different company today. we are not the same business that we were years ago. and we are not yet the business that we'll become in the next few years. we are in a process of transformation, and we are moving fast.
second, we are very confident in our strategy. and this confidence motivates us to accelerate and remain focused on execution with discipline. third, it is certain that we will direct our team, our assets and our skill set to be a larger and more profitable company in the next few years. we can see many opportunities ahead of us, despite the short-term challenges we are facing; fourth, we have today a very united leadership team, a company focused on the execution of our plan in a high level of alignment, motivation and energy in the entire organization, which has made a big difference in our process of recovery after the pandemic.
and fifth, embraer is a company that is concerned with the environment. and one of the first in the industry to adopt advanced norms of environmental management and social responsibility in its region with high governance and ethical standards. we are committed to esg, and we will progress even further on this agenda. finally, our founder, ozires silva, the first brazilian and one of the few non-americas to be recognized with the daniel guggenheim medal, which is granted as one of the highest awards in aviation used to say embraer always challenged the impossible and is capable of getting where it wants, thanks to the passion and competency to always do the best.
we preserve and incentivize this passion in the high competency of our engineering force and other areas. and now with more focus on results and simplicity of actions, we are sure that we are making a difference to be a bigger and more profitable organization for our shareholders. thank you very much.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from josh milberg with morgan stanley. one moment, please, mr. josh. florencia torres with metlife, you may proceed.
unknown speaker
hello, everyone. thanks for taking my question, and congratulations for the results. i have two questions. one is regarding cost.
if you are expecting any issue regarding the shortage of supply that everyone is suffering in the coming quarters. or any strategy in terms of inventories regarding that? the other one is regarding targets on the leverage for next year. we are expecting to back to the three times level. thank you.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
so for the first part with regards to shortage, we -- just a moment. with regards to shortage, we -- i would say we are -- for this -- to the end of 2021, we may have some issues, but the material is confirmed. maybe they will not arrive in time, that's why we still keep a range when we give the guidance. and for our production planning for next year, we also have the confirmation from our partners, our suppliers.
but we are going to follow up on a daily basis because we know that the whole industry is being affected by the shortage. and what we are doing to some extent, we are also cautiously building up some material, especially where we do see more risks associated with this shortage especially for next year. and your second question, i was not able to understand. could you repeat that?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
it's about the leverage, antonio, if we expect to reach a leverage of three times next year.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
we are confident that this year will be net debt per ebitda around four, maybe slightly better. and we are confident that we are going to reach the level next year at three. that's more or less our planning. and just to remind, one year ago, we were at 20.
and we should close this year, i would say, four or even slightly below. and next year, having no doubt that we are going to reach the three. thank you.
unknown speaker
perfect. thank you so much.
operator
the next question comes from josh milberg with morgan stanley.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, everyone. thank you for the call, and congrats on the results. i had several questions on the executive business. and just for starters, with that good book-to-bill that you mentioned and the strong backlog, i was hoping you could talk a little bit about the executive pricing environment.
we've gotten some input from the industry folk in recent months, suggesting some meaningful upward moves, but it would be good to get your perspective on that. and as a second question, you mentioned being at the las vegas exhibition, and i wanted to see if you could touch on the competitive landscape and if you're seeing any competitor product developments that could pose a threat longer term.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
well, thank you, josh. so i mean the business jet industry is really -- has been really a good surprise for us -- for all of us this year, right? i mean, the business jet industry is growing likely to reach 10% year over year in 2021. and this is good for all of us. we have been doing very well with our team and enjoying this market with a good discipline in prices, so which has helped us.
i mean, showing a good result in executive. we do believe -- well, we are sold out until the first quarter 2023, as i said before. we have a great -- in regard to competition, we do believe we have a great portfolio of products with the phenoms, phenom 100, the phenom 300 that continues to be our best seller. but also doing very well with operators, the 500 and the 600.
we do believe in the market. i mean, in las vegas, we do believe that we want to have a soft landing of the demand from 2022 and 2023 onwards with the growth -- average growth to the pre-pandemic levels of one digit. but so far, i think we are doing very well in the executive market.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and good to hear that you sort of -- you see a soft landing, because this is an industry that's seen a number of false starts in recent years. and there's the issue, of course, of how much covid has been boosting your performance there in the overall industry performance.
if i might just squeeze one more question in on the commercial side. just wanted to hear a little bit about how your campaigns have been evolving there and how you're seeing the 2022 delivery scenario at this point.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
it's still above the executive jet. we have other reasons to believe that this -- the soft landing, i'd say, right? i mean the wealth -- the global wealth growth, the economic activity, and the market liquidity. also the preowned market, that is one of the lowest levels ever, right? we are below 5% in the normal levels, 5% on the fleet in operation. the levels -- normal levels used to be double of that.
and this -- and also now the first-time users and first-time buyers in this market also are good indicators that we are in a different level. it's not that we are growing not only because of the covid, but there are other reasons for that, right? regarding the commercial, we are also optimistic with the market. i mean, the new one, 100% of our e175 fleet is already back in service. and this aircraft has been fundamental to support the market recovery.
so our market intelligence has indicated that there are over 500 aircraft in north america to be replaced in the next 10 years and our e175-e1 is the only scope-compliant aircraft in production today. so good perspectives for the e1. and also the rightsizing post-covid is going to benefit our e2s. i mean, we have a strong sales activity.
i could say that we have a triple-digit number of aircraft under activity commercial discussions. and also, this increased pressure from environment, co2 reduction, puts our e2 in a very good position as we have the most environmentally friendly aircraft in that category. so because of that, we are really optimistic with -- also with the commercial aviation for the next years.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and you're saying that -- i mean -- and just to add a point here. i mean, on the e2 having this esg angle, i mean that very sort of angle does not, in any way, kind of pose a threat to the e1 just given the lack of alternatives at this point, even with oil prices being where they are from your standpoint?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
could you please repeat that, please?
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
well, i was just making the point that, i mean, you're highlighting the environmentally friendly driver of the e2, and just wanting to raise the question of e1 being sort of a last-generation aircraft and high oil prices today that, that, in your view does not in any way threaten demand for the e1 just because there are no alternatives?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
well, i think short term is the perspective we have for e1s. but in parallel, we are still working in the new alternatives. i mean the turboprop new generation is one of them. we have seen stronger interest from customers on that project.
and everything is going well for a business plan for that aircraft to be approved by the second half of next year. and we consider with the e175-e2 as well. so we have to continue working that project.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. really appreciate all the perspective.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
just to complement one point here in regards to the planning for 2022. you saw in my speech, we sold 64 commercial jets. and it should be something -- slightly above 60 aircraft for next year, something like that. just to give you, to memory, to confirming with the suppliers with the customer.
but just to give you a perspective, it's more or less where is yourselves next year.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. that's good visibility. really appreciate it.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
thank you, josh.

our next question comes from ron epstein of bank of america.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. a couple of questions. so the cash flow in the quarter clearly was good.
now in the past, it's been lumpy. so i mean, how should we think about cash flow going forward? is this a trend toward better cash flow on a more consistent basis? or is this more of a onetime thing?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ron, this is antonio speaking. thanks for your question. as i mentioned in previous calls, with this, i would say, the cash flow generation on a sustainable base. i would say, in a mid-term perspective, we should be able to show free cash flow, i would say, 50% of our ebit for the first beginning.
that's more or less the $100 million that we are disclosing right now. and assuming the growth that we are in the recovery here, that should be more or less following for the coming years. it's more that our projections are telling us. we are, i would say, quite diligent for investment in new products.
you know even into more details and highly focused on cash generation for the legacy business. new business, we need to find alternatives to not compromise the legacy business we have in the company here.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
and if allow me to complement that. ron, francisco speaking now. we also continue to work on actions to reduce the inventory, to increase the turnover of our inventories, and to reduce the working capital in our operations. so all of these activities, combined with the growth, will make us to believe that we will continue with this good performance in cash generation.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. and when you think about ebitda margins, how should we think about where those could go as you work through the efficiency programs? is there sort of like a notional target we could think about as investors?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ron, for sure, to date and no-brainer, we are close to 8.9% year to date. that should be, i would say, in the long run, we do see ourselves between 10% to 15%, but it does not mean that we are happy with those numbers, but it's already a good sign for us. it's more or less our long-term planning.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so if we were to think a range of 10% to 15%, that's a reasonable range, and potentially maybe even higher depending on how things go.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
absolutely. we do see the recovery in the commercial aviation slowing down coming back 2023, '24, let's say, it's more value to monetize, but it's going to take longer because of the recovery of the commercial jets.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. got it. and then maybe on that front, on the commercial jet front, what are you seeing in terms of sales, campaigns, activity? as we start thinking about 2022, how do you think that year could -- and i know you haven't guided yet for 2022, so i'm not really asking you for that.
but just broadly, do you have a sense on how 2022 from an order activity front could appear for the e-jets?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
well, ron, i think, as i said before, in the answer before, we see good perspectives for the e175-e1s because of the quick rebound in the us market for domestic flights, very good opportunities we have in the next years. in the e2s as well, as i said before, we are working in a lot of our commercial campaigns. in this, this rightsizing post covid, this increasing pressure from environment, this puts our e2 in a good position. i mentioned also this first experience -- first experience of the helvetic airways in the london city.
i mean, many things are happening that we believe we put our e2 house in a good position for next year onwards. we are optimistic with both of those products.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ron, i just want to come back to the ebitda margin issuance. it's important to mention if you see the q3 and we try to give you guys information in order that you do the math because we do -- as you know, we have some costs that we are handled in a central way, in the corporation, without affecting the margin of the business units, like the integration of the commercial aviation, arbitration costs, and we are still structuring the company. and i would say, we are today, without this, already above 10%. but we are not adjusting because we don't want to disclose those numbers.
but without this, we are already above 10% today.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. got it. and then maybe just one last question, if i may.
on the -- there's been a lot of discussion around the potential of maybe a new turboprop, a new platform. where does that stand?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
well ron, as also as i said before, i mean we are seeing a very strong interest from customers, i mean, suppliers and also investors in that product. and everything is going very well for the business plan approval by the second half of next year. so we are also very optimistic with the development of this product -- of this new product.
ron epstein -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. got it. thank you very much.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
you're welcome, ron.

our next question comes from victor mizusaki with bradesco bbi.
victor mizusaki -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
hi. first, congrats for the solid results. i have two questions here. the first one is related to guarantee deposits, right? i mean, we saw a material increase in the third quarter.
so i'd like to know if it could make sense for us to talk some of that commercial car delivers for 2022? i mean, if we compare what happened this year with warranty deposits and delivers, if we try to estimate what could happen in 2022, that maybe the company could deliver more than 60 aircraft next year, commercial aircraft? and the second question is related to provisions. i mean, the write-off that the company booked in the third quarter. when we take a look at the audit figures, we can see a write-off of brl 33 million. so i don't know if you can give additional details.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
victor, thanks for your question. let's say, start, from the answer to the provision side. we have some movements in our obsolete materials that we are selling right now. that's why we did an adjustment in q3.
it's not a big issue. it will come back in the coming months as soon as we get the material sold and delivered. and i would say we do have a chance to be above 60. but we are -- continues to discuss shortage management, especially the suppliers in order to make sure that we will be able to fulfill the cost.
the situation is not, let's say, first starting different industry like automotive, but we are seeing right now that, assuming that we are picking up, our competitor are picking up that we may see more restrictions that we are seeing today. but we do have space to be above 60, and we are going to guide -- give a guidance for 2022 in our next call.
victor mizusaki -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
and, antonio, if i may, just a quick one. you mentioned some expense with the arbitration process with boeing. can you give any kind of update on this matter?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. unfortunately, we are not able -- we are not allowed to give too much detail, and that's why we are not adjusting the cost. or you could do the math in a different way, but we are -- what i can tell you, we are in the process to continue, and next year would be more or less, i would say, a kind of important year for the arbitration. but it's going to take more two years, i think.
victor mizusaki -- bradesco bbi -- analyst
ok. thank you.

the next question comes from marcelo motta with j.p. morgan.
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking the questions. two questions as well. first, if you guys could provide any update regarding eve and the evtol business.
i mean we all know the material fact that the negotiation is going. so just wondering how you guys feel about the negotiations, if there have been any bottleneck or anything that might be leading to a lower-than-expected conclusion for that. and the second question is regarding services and support. i mean, the segment continue to show a very strong growth, continue to have solid margin.
you announced several agreements during the quarter. so just wondering if you guys can provide us some expectations on how much this line could grow or how much those new agreements have been adding to revenue or how much they could add in revenues in the midterm.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
thank you, marcelo, for the questions. the first one regarding eve, what i can tell you is that negotiations with our partner, zanite are ongoing. but we cannot comment further. the company will keep the market informed of any relevant developments of this operation.
about the second one, yes, you are right, i mean, our services and support area is doing very well. it's enjoying the return to operation of our aircraft, both in commercial and executive business. and we have -- yes, we have good plans to grow further in that area, not only with embraer aircraft market, but also in the non-embraer aircraft market. we have, as we said in the previous call, we signed an important contract with pratt & whitney for the gtf engine maintenance in portugal.
it's a multibillion contract. and this will allow us to grow that operation in portugal, almost triple the revenues in the next years, and this will help our service at embraer as well. so again, we have very good perspective and opportunities to grow our services and support area.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
two digits growth --
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
yes. two digits growth, every year, exactly, for the next five years.

the next question comes from noah poponak with goldman sachs.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
hi, noah.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
the commentary around being sold out next year on executive deliveries, at what level of delivery is that the case? and that being sold into the first quarter of 2023, how -- what do you want that lead time to be on a sustainable basis?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
noah, thanks a lot for the question. i mean, as i said, well, we are sold out through the first quarter 2023 actually. so our team is doing a great job enjoying this good momentum in the market. so we are still -- we are working this production plan for next year, but we do believe it is still in another two-digit growth for next year.
and as i said before, we believe in a soft landing of the demand from '22, 2023 onwards. i mean, with a growth average closer to the normal pre-crisis, that there would be one-digit growth. and because of many reasons, as i said before, the wealth growth, the pre-owned fleet, and the new users and new buyers that are coming to this market. so this is our view on the executive market.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so you're planning for double-digit growth in units 2022 versus 2021?
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
correct.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
can you tell us what -- do you happen to have the number on the exact book-to-bill in executive in the quarter? i know you said it was over two, but if you just happen to have that precise number, that would be helpful.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
as i said before, it's in excess of 2:1, the book-to-bill.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and just to confirm the cash flow conversion target you're referring to, 50%. that's ebita, e-b-i-t-a as opposed to ebit or ebitda?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
noah, for the first beginning, ebit operating results, 50% commercial. for the first beginning, recall regarding, merging, with upside quotation. but i do see today in a short term 50% what we generate in regards to ebit, not ebitda.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
50%, five-zero free cash flow to ebit?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. because we are still having a higher interest cost in our company. we was a company two, three years ago $6 billion revenue. today, we are at $4 billion revenue.
and we still have this issue of being able to generate enough, i would say, business size in order to be able to compensate the interest. that's why i give you, for the time being, these metrics. but i promise you guys, i'm going to refine this number for the next call.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. ok. thanks so much.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thank you.

the next question comes from jack ayers with cowen & company.
jack ayers -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey. good morning. this is jack on for cai today. i guess just previously following up on the margin commentary, it looks like your guide implies ebitda margin improving sequentially from q3 to q4.
i guess if you could just talk about or provide a framework for how we think about q4 margin by segment. like is it defense, biz jet, i think your guide implies q4 biz jet deliveries sort of expanding here in q4. if you could just provide some color around the key sort of moving pieces around margin there, would be helpful. and then on just backlog and book-to-bill, specifically this quarter, if you could provide what the defense and commercial backlog was, that would be great.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, jack, for your question. if you see today our year to date either ebit or ebitda margin, we are at, i would say, at the high end of our guidance. we do see for q4 highly driven by executive aviation, because we do have, i would say, more or less 40% of the delivery is going to happen in q4. that's the first point.
commercial aviation is more or less close to breakeven. then services and support, also then with upside potential. we do have difference at the same level. but we are cautious on the ebitda and ebitda margin guidance because we are still negotiating with brazilian air force, the contract -- the current contract of the kc.
we may have some risks that i don't want to say -- saying that we are going to improve it because we still have a challenge here to end of this year. that's why we decided to keep the ebit and ebitda guidance at the same level. for sure, today, we are much better, in the high end, but we do have a challenge to end up this fiscal year. in regards to the backlog, defense on the quarter, we have, i would say, added no new contracts in defense.
in just a moment here, the us defense and commercial. in commercial, we added the 15 skywest that we booked in q3 on the backlog.
jack ayers -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. got it. and then i guess just as a follow-up to cash, it looks like you're increasing your cash guide for full year. what about '22 cash, like how we should think about that growing off of this '21 base? and is that really just a function of volume and deliveries?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. we do see for next year all cities range between $100 million to $200 million. i don't have to give our guidance right now. but we -- assuming that we are coming back to, i would say, not pre-pandemic level, but it's likely below the pre-pandemic level, we should be able to keep between $100 million to $200 million because we continue in the efficient problem is not only driven by delivery itself, but everything you are doing with regards to inventory management, purchasing, improving the working capital, we still have, i would say, a potential to improve this figure that we are seeing right now.
jack ayers -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ok.

the next question comes from matias vammalle with bluebay asset management.
matias vammalle -- bluebay asset management -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. i think a big part of my questions have been addressed, but just piggybacking on the most recent one. again, just trying to think about working capital into next year as i see some offsetting forces on the one hand.
you have fairly low inventory levels right now, and we're seeing increases in a lot of input costs. and to the extent that you see some upside in your potential deliveries next year, i would imagine inventories can be a bit of a drag on working capital. on the other hand, you're seeing better-contracted liabilities. so again, just trying to understand perhaps the different push and pull dynamics of your working capital.
if you could just comment a little bit on, again, your expectations on inventories kind of going forward. and if you think that can be offset by other work.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question, matías. and this is a good opportunity to meet -- to share with you guys those other activities we are doing. so first of all, our five-year plan is focused on the sales of the existing product portfolio. and we do have, as i said before, the potential to almost double the revenue of the company in this period, focusing on the existing portfolio of products.
last year, we went through an important rightsizing program of this company. and also, we started to focus on important initiatives to reduce the cost of our aircraft to focus on improving our accounts receivable and to increase the turns of our inventories. we have the target to almost triple the turns of our inventory turnover in the next three to four years. so again, i mean, with all these activities, rightsizing the company, to reduce the cost of the products, to reduce the expense, to manage responsibly the sg&a of the company, going to a period of more growth that we expect from 2022 onwards, then we expect that we'll improve our financial performance, either in the profitability and more specifically in the cash generation as well as stated by antonio before.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
just to complete, matias, if you ask me today, we continue in the crisis mode here. we know about inflation -- high inflation in brazil or worldwide, with how much is reduced. we are -- we have the contracts backing in regards to pass through, i would say. and we continue to run efficiencies in our production or back costs in order to offset any additional deviation we may have.
matias vammalle -- bluebay asset management -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much.

the next question comes from nicolas fabiancic with jefferies.
nicolas fabiancic -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. thank you, guys, for the call, and congratulations on the results. just a quick one here on the rating agencies. after these strong results, the strong recovery, it's notable to us that the three agencies still have you on negative outlook.
doesn't seem to make any sense. we actually think that there's a credible path here back to investment grade. so just wondering what's the latest in terms of conversations with them, timing with the agencies. and then on liability management, you guys mentioned the level of interest expenses and sort of thinking about reducing gross debt.
how would potential issuance fit into those plans, maybe coming back to the market opportunistically with a new 10-year? and specifically, i wanted to ask around the esg agenda that you guys mentioned. clearly, we've seen a lot of brazilian corporate focus on esg and doing things like sustainability-linked bonds. so is that something that you guys are already starting to think about?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
nicolas, thanks for the question. i start with the rating. we just take, for example, fitch. we are one notch below investment grade.
the last week, the report this year, then this was negative. they already changed it to stable. and i do believe we are going, with the new information we are providing, they are going to put in the positive trend. and it's my hope that we get back our investment grade in 2022, most probably end of 2022.
that's the first question. and for sure, we are with regards to universal liability management, we are discussing, and q3 will be the basis for the debt market to go to refinance our debts and increase the length for maturity level. that's also in our agenda. and these bonds will be a red esg bond, a green bond.

francisco neto -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter call today. i hope that all of you are well and safe. thank you for your interest in our company. as you will see later in antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were in line with our internal expectations, and with cash generation coming better than planned.
the q3 results continue to show that our strategic planning and its execution are showing tangible, positive results for the company. before we go into more financial details on the third quarter, i'd like to touch on some highlights in each of our business segments. in commercial aviation, we delivered nine e-jets in the third quarter. and so far in 2021, we have delivered 32, aircraft in line with our forecast for the year.
we continued to show positive momentum on the order front, with another 60 aircraft in a firm order with skywest, leading to book-to-bill in excess of 2:1 this year. also within commercial aviation, a milestone was reached when swiss airline helvetic airways performed the first revenue-generating flight of the e2 to london city airport. the ability of the e2 to attend to this strategic airport will allow for further penetration of this family of jets in the european market. in executive aviation, we continue to see very good momentum on the demand front and in the third quarter this business registered record.
further, our portfolio of finance and products is sold out through 2022 and into the first quarter of 2023, leading to book-to-bill in excess of 2:1. and this doesn't -- it includes the deal we announced at nbaa in las vegas of $1.2 billion sale of up to 100 phenom 300e aircraft. finally, we delivered the 1,500 embraer executive jet in the third quarter, showing our rapid growth within this industry as it only took us 20 years to reach this milestone, when the rest of the industry players took, on average, 34 years to deliver that many aircrafts. on the next slide, we start with the highlights from the defense and security.
during the third quarter, our subsidiary atech delivered an updated version of the brazilian air traffic management system, which will be able to unify all flight plan processing in brazilian aerospace. also, we delivered six super tucanos to different customers, underlining the continued demand we see for this market-leading light attack in trainee aircraft. we also continue to negotiate the kc-390 production contract with the brazilian air force, and we will share additional information regarding this matter once it becomes available. the services and support continues its recovery along with commercial and business jet traffic globally.
and we recently were able to attend the mro europe event in person a few weeks ago. during the event, we had several sales announcements, including a full program support contract with klm cityhopper for its entire planned e195-e2 fleet which, at present, is expected to be the largest e2 operator in europe. we are also proud that the executive aviation services placed first again in propilot product support surveys for 2021 and was third place in the ain survey. finally, our ogma mro subsidiary in portugal was honored with a top 10 ranking of mro service centers in europe for 2021, a great sign, as we expected to significantly grow this business in the coming years with exciting new business to ramp up.
on the next slide, with respect to innovation, we continue to make progress on partnerships in the urban air mobility ecosystem through our subsidiary eve in a segment with strong growth potential in the years to come. further, our embraerx signed a multiyear agreement with the republic airways for the use of beacon's maintenance coordination platform. although currently not very large in terms of financial results, we see a very interesting opportunity for beacon to grow and add new customers over the next few years. embraerx also announced a partnership with pyka, a silicon valley company to accelerate the future of autonomous aerial agriculture operations.
this quarter, we are going to start sharing some highlights regarding enterprise excellence. we reached the lowest inventory level since 2018, with a reduction of 22% in the last 12 months. in terms of operational efficiency, we reached an increase of 6.5% and also a reduction of 10% in the production lead time of our aircraft. i will now hand it over to antonio to give further detail on the financial results, and i will return in the end.
thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thank you, francisco, and good morning, everyone. i would like to start with our backlog. we ended the third quarter with a backlog of $16.8 billion. this is up 20% in six months and is the second consecutive quarter-over-quarter increase this year.
looking at each segment. we have a good sales activity in our commercial aviation business, with another 16 firm orders from skywest, bringing total firm orders this year to 64 commercial jets. in executive aviation, a strong backlog continues across the entire portfolio, with record third quarter sales and a book-to-bill ratio in excess of 2:1. backlog in services and support also grew from prior quarter's level.
in summary, our backlog has reached levels not seen since 2019. this gives us confidence our fit for growth plans are working and revenue and profitability will continue to increase. moving to deliveries. in the third quarter, we delivered nine commercial jets and 21 executive jets for a total of 30 aircrafts during the period.
the nine deliveries in commercial aviation represents a 29% increase compared to the third quarter 2020. year to date, deliveries were at 32, a 100% increase over the same period last year. of the 32 deliveries, 17 were e2. sales continued to perform very well, showing a recovery in our core markets.
executive aviation delivered 14 light jets and seven large jets for a total of 21 aircraft in the third quarter. year to date, deliveries were at 54, a 25 increase -- 25% increase over the same period last year. we expect these positive trends to continue with 2021 deliveries of commercial aviation jets reaching between 45 to 50 aircrafts and the executive jets between 90 to 95 aircrafts by the end of this year. turning to net revenue.
third quarter net revenue was $958 million, up 26% from the same quarter last year. commercial aviation revenue growth was driven by higher deliveries, while executive aviation growth was due to a more favorable mix of deliveries. services and support growth was due to the expanded commercial executive and defense services. defense also posted a revenue increase due to advances in our main programs and the deliveries of super tucanos.
year to date, net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 50% from last year. we had solid revenue growth as all of our business units posted higher third quarter and year-to-date revenue compared to 2020. we expect fourth quarter '21 revenues to remain strong, and we expect to end this year between $4 billion to $4.5 billion in revenue. looking at sg&a.
sg&a continues to trend favorably over the last seven quarters. year to date, sg&a was down $48 million or 15% compared to the same period in 2020. as a percentage of revenue, year to date, sg&a was at 9.1%, compared to 16.1% in the first nine months of 2020, down a full 7 percentage points. selling expenses was up due to increased sales and market activities, demo flights, and in-person customer engagements.
although the trend is up, selling expenses is far below 2021 levels -- 2020 levels, sorry, due to our focus on more cost-effective ways to reach our customers. as a percentage of revenue, year-to-date selling expenses was 5.2%, less than half of the 10.8% level in the same period of 2020. general and administrative expenses were $36 million this quarter, equal to the average of the last seven quarters. as a percentage of revenue, g&a has held steady at 4% in each of the three quarters this year.
it's important to reinforce, we remain highly focused on sg&a efficiencies and apply lean principles to our sg&a functions. moving on to ebit and ebitda. we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in margin performance for the company. for the third quarter, on a consolidated basis, our adjusted ebit margin was 3.7%, and our adjusted ebitda margin was 8.3%, both up over 9 percentage points compared to the same quarter in the prior year.
year-to-date margins are similar, with adjusted ebit at 3.8% and adjusted ebitda at 8.9%, both above last year. on a dollar basis, year-to-date adjusted ebit was $111 million compared to a loss of $177 million in 2020. and adjusted ebitda was positive with $258 million, compared to a loss of $63 million in 2020. in our business segment, adjusted ebit margin for the quarter were as follows: commercial aviation was at 4.5%, improvement from last year on higher deliveries and improvement mix.
executive aviation was at 6.7% driven by robust price discipline and consistent profitability. defense and security was at 10%, resulting from a good mix of super tucanos and kc deliveries. services and support was also at 10.8% with improved service contract performance. additional expenses related to interrogation costs, ongoing arbitration costs, and other nonbusiness-related costs explain the total company margin is slightly below the business segment average.
these improvements on ebit and ebitda margin are results of our fit for grow initiatives and enterprise efficiencies. this next slide shows our adjusted net income for the quarter. adjusted net income was a loss of $1 million or $0.18 per ads. although negative, net income is trending up on a trailing 12-month basis, driven primarily by revenue growth and corporate efficiencies.
and as our top line grows, our fixed cost leverage and financial level will improve, providing additional positive impact on earnings. moving on to investment and cash flow. i'd like to first highlight our remarkable cash flow recovery. third quarter adjusted free cash flow was a positive $21 million, which was the first time in more than 10 years we generated positive free cash flow during the third quarter given the seasonality of the business.
more efficient inventory management, better production planning, and strong sales and executive and commercial and the down payments associated with the sales have led to our positive cash flow in the quarter. on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted free cash flow was negative $160 million. although negative, this is far better than where we were this time last year. looking to the fourth quarter, we expect these positive cash flow trends to continue.
so today, we are taking the opportunity to increase our 2021 free cash flow guidance to positive $100 million or better. we are very happy that only one year after the worst downturn in the aerospace history, embraer generates positive free cash flow, emphasize not only our top-line recovery but also results of our cost and working capital initiatives. now to investments. our total investment were $56 million in the third quarter and $145 million year to date, both in line with last year.
this is important because it shows we continue to balance the need to invest in our future with the need to preserve cash. this next slide shows our cash and liquidity position. we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion cash and cash equivalents, a slight increase from the prior two quarters. our debt balance was at $4.3 billion, with net debt of $1.8 billion.
both are slight decreased from three months ago. our average debt to maturity decreased to 3.8 years. we expect to continue to generate cash in the fourth quarter and beyond. so our leverage will naturally decrease.
we remain focused on generating cash, reducing our debt level and improve our credit metrics. and of course, lower debt levels, we reduce our net interest expenses and have a positive impact on net income. finally, as i mentioned earlier in my remarks, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to positive $100 million or better. guidance in all other metrics remain unchanged.
with that, i conclude my presentation and hand it back to francisco for his final remarks. thank you very much.
francisco neto -- chief executive officer
thanks, antonio. the third quarter and year-to-date results reinforce our confidence in our strategy. during the last nine months, we have just seen the net revenue was up 50% from last year, sg&a expenses down 15%, and adjusted ebitda at 8.9%. all that means, focus and discipline in executing our long-term strategic plan.
in a year of recovery on top of sales and deliveries, the efficiency gains projects have proved to be a key element in improving the company's performance. the updated guidance with a positive free cash flow for the full year shows not only the good momentum of the company, but also the combined focus on the top line and higher profitability. regarding esg practice, we are also making progress on our journey. this quarter, we announced new esg commitments, which include to be carbon-neutral in our operations by 2040, using 100% energy from renewable sources in sustainable aviation fuel in our own flights.
we will also work together with the suppliers in the whole industry to achieve a net-zero carbon emission aviation by 2050, developing products based on sustainable technologies such as electrification, hybrid propulsion, and hydrogen. a final note regarding innovation. this quarter, we were awarded by the largest and most prestigious finance newspaper in brazil, valor econômico, as the most innovative company in the country among all sectors. it is an incredible recognition for all of those who work to make embraer a face of excellence in engineering, innovation, and technology.
thanks to our great team for their focus and passion on creating disruptive and sustainable technologies and executing our strategic plan. we thank you all for your interest and confidence in our company.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from myles walton, ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i was hoping on the guidance for 2022 that you could perhaps give a little bit more color by segment? and in particular, given the margin pressure you had in 2021 in defense, i would have expected the margins to -- at the midpoint, be better than 2021. so maybe if you can just give some color there.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
hi, myles. this is antonio speaking. thanks for your question. so basically, what you are seeing in regards to guidance for 2020.
one-by the way, we know that you guys maybe don't like to mute we don't like either, but we have effects in our numbers that is not helping us for 2022 as we would like to see. but basically, what we are seeing in are margin by segment is starting with commercial variation, we closed 2021 with minus 1.7%, and we do see a black zero for 2022 with more volumes, but we do have a little bit cost for the pp that we are spending money and not capitalizing, ok? that's why i do see a black zero here. executive aviation, we will still continue at the high single-digit level for 2022 without services, ok? defense that's-one issue that's concerned us right now. we closed 2021 with 3.8%, and we are going to suffer a little bit in 2022, and we do see a zero in 2022 because all budgets were cut, especially in front of the brazilian government here, therefore, we are going to suffer in 2022.
that's one of our headwinds we have in our guidance. service & support, we do see i would say, constant margin the level we closed for 2021, 14%. if you put all together, it's more than our guidance, but please take into account we do have costs on the corporate level, which is more or less eating up 1.5%-more or less 1.5% margin with the integration of commercial aviation arbitration costs that we are not adjusted to you guys. but if you want to make an adjustment in your math, then you are going to see that we are in the range of 6% of the business.
we have a part of this extraordinary effects that is going to hit our numbers for 2022.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. great color. yes. no, that was good color.
so on the [inaudible] embraer costs, i think you implied it's something like $65 million in '22. does that go to zero in '23? or are we done in '22?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
we cannot comment too much, but i would say we do expect to finish in 2023 and-but is always-assuming that you cannot tell too much about the arbitration process, that's, i would say, the time line should end up in 2023. that's our hope. but i would say, let's see.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
ok. thank you. i'll leave to one question. thanks again.

our next question comes from [inaudible], metlife.
unknown speaker
hi, guys. congratulations on the results. i have two questions. one is a follow-up regarding guidance and more focus on free cash flow.
if you can comment on working capital assumptions on how you get the $50 million? and the other one regarding esg, particularly, if you have any update on msci comment a couple of months ago [inaudible] is flat on the name. if you have any answers from the agency or any comments on that?
francisco gomes neto
for russia, i think antonio can help you with the guidance, but i'd like you to repeat the question about esg that i wasn't able to understand. we have agreed with us here to help, but we need to understand better your question.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. we got here francisco who is going to answer the question. for instance, regards to the cash flow, we do see our working capital stable in 2022. and the free cash flow guidance is a result of the -- includes the -- we are seeing $50 million better because it includes also the out of the divestiture we are doing in portugal that should contribute with $150 million for 2022.
it's important to mention, our outlook does not include any cash inflow out of the business, ok? it's just the legacy business that we have. working capital fixed and the divestiture is going to help us in the free cash flow. and the msci level is going to answer.
unknown speaker
about msci, we actually just got a message stating that they have taken they have took everything in consideration. so we don't have any flag items on msci. so our rating should reflect that. so no more cluster bomb ammunition issues whatsoever.
operator
our next question comes from josh milberg, morgan stanley.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, francisco and antonio, and thank you, guys for the detailed presentation. i also had a follow-up on the guidance and your indication that a breakeven ebit margin could be a reasonable expectation for the commercial division this year, and was specifically just hoping that you could comment a little further on the mix, pricing, and other key variables driving that indication. i think on the portuguese call today, with respect to pricing, you suggested that you expect it to keep pace with inflation for your overall operations. but any additional color there would be great.
francisco gomes neto
ok. let's start with the last question, josh, and then i will ask antonio to help with the guidance. so regarding the pricing, we have followed very closely the movements of price and costs to make sure that we are keeping a healthy situation for our margins. so we will continue with our initiatives to reduce costs internally.
we have this cogs reduction project. we have the production -- the aircraft production lead-time reduction. we will continue to focus a lot on those initiatives. and of course, if we see an impact in one of our commodities that are higher, or products we buy that are higher and we are able to compensate, then we have to pass on to the price.
this is the way we are doing. we are monitoring very closely this movements in price and costs of our-from our suppliers and the price to our customers and the internal costs as well. antonio, would you like to clarify something about the guidance, please?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. josh, in regards to the mix for the commercial aviation, that's important to highlight. we do have more e1s in 2022 compared with 2021. it's more or less 50% more e1, where we do have just 28 more e2s, means have a different mix, which impacts revenue because we have a lower ticket or lower average price for the e2, e1s compared with e2s also impact a bit the margins.
in regards to the price the price increase tech we do have in those platforms, something like 2% to 3%, i would say, normal condition [inaudible] having our contracts for our suppliers and customers. and that's more or less the premises we have pass-through as long are not able to offset. however, there is a risk today in the market with hyperinflation. we are impacting commodities that we are quantifying right now.
at least, no risk, but it could change next week or the next 10 days, we don't know. but i would say, for the commercial aviation, it's more e1s that's bringing the revenue a little bit down and e2s. and on top of it, when i mentioned the margin, we are investing $50 million for the predevelopment of tp, which has also impacted the margin for 2022. if you validate the business case, you may capitalize it.
for the time being, we are booking as a cost. it's more or less what did you see in the aviation coming to a black zero, and we hope throughout the year, we are able to improve ebit.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. great color. antonio, thank you, francisco, as well. have a nice day.
francisco gomes neto
thank you, josh.

our next question comes from marcelo motta, j.p. morgan.
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, everyone. just a follow-up on the guidance for 2022. i mean just to understand, you always talk about adjusted margins, adjusted ebit margin. but it seems that this year, you guys are commenting about a negative impact of 1.5 percentage points on this adjusted margin coming from integration cost as well as arbitrage costs.
however, i mean, i have the impression that every year, you guys have been adjusting the margin for that. so maybe the i don't know if the guidance is included in this 1.5% that is not really comparable to the margins that we were seeing in the previous years. so just want to make sure that they were getting this correct.
francisco gomes neto
marcelo, we never -- and i have just two years in the company, and i took a look back in ever just the carve-out or caving cost, it's more or less what you are talking about. this is embedded, included in the ebitda margin is the same for the arbitration is in there. if you would -- you want to do a math, we don't consider that, we will see embraer in a better margin what we are seeing today, but we are not adjusting the steel costs. it's included in our adjusted ebitda ok?
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and do you think it's fair to say that most of those costs will happen during the first quarter?
francisco gomes neto
no. no. for the integration, yes, but for the ratios. but for the arbitration costs, you'll be spread out the whole year more or less.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
exactly.
marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much
operator
our next question comes from matias vammalle, bluebay asset.
matias vammalle -- bluebay asset management -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. i just wanted to double-check, which ties up with the margins, but also the deliveries. given the impact-or given the effect that we're seeing on higher commodity prices, how you think you can handle that again.
i presume a fair bit of that is already factored in your expected deliveries and your margins, which are roughly flat to this year. but if you can comment a little bit more on what you think the impact could be, or how you would handle, again, higher commodity prices and also some of the challenges that other manufacturing companies are facing such as semiconductor shortages? thank you.
francisco gomes neto
well, matías, thanks for the question. again, i think antonio already clarified this point of cost and price, right? we are monitoring very closely this movement. we have internal programs to offset some price increase. but if the cost increase is above of what we are able to offset and there's no alternative then to pass it through the price.
we have already some escalation established in our contracts either with suppliers and with customers. that is a kind of protection. if anything out of this, then we have to discuss how to offset, but we believe we are in a good position for the guidance. in regards, as antonio said, i mean, it's considering the situation, right? i mean, we believe we might have opportunities, but we prefer to have a commitment with you that we will deliver at the end of the year.
and also antonio also mentioned that in the case of commercial aviation, we will have this $50 million impact because of initial costs of the turboprop. that if we approve the business case by the end of this year, beginning of next year, this will be -- will become investments. but at this point of time, we are contabilizing as costs.
operator
our next question comes from noah poponak, goldman sachs.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everybody.
francisco gomes neto
good morning.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
it's a decent -- it was a decent order year last year in commercial. it seems like there's a lot of replacement potential. maybe you could just speak to how heavy the campaigning activity is, maybe where you expect orders to come in, in commercial in 2022? and then i guess, how sold out -- how much visibility do you have for the delivery profile beyond this year?
francisco gomes neto
well, i mean, for the deliveries this year, we are facing some difficulties with the supply chain, but we are working very hard to anticipate the issues and mitigate those risks as we did last year. last year, we did a good job. we also faced some issues with the supply chain, but we were able to deliver all the aircraft planned. so same way, we are going this year in order to mitigate issues and to deliver the aircraft.
regarding sales, i mean we have a lot of sales campaigns ongoing in commercial aviation. and yes, we have to -- we have this potential impact of the war, the oil price increase, but also maybe some upsides because maybe the domestic market will be less affected than the long flights, and we have the most efficient aircraft in the market. so maybe this will be an upside for our sales during this year.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and where do you think the adjusted ebitda margin can go over time once you've recovered pre-pandemic commercial volumes?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
no. we do see in our -- in the mid-term, the mid-single-digit margin. it's important to mention without services. if we include services, you'll be much higher and the same.
we did 1.7. if i would add the services side will be positive mid-single digits already in 2021. with only aircraft sales, we do see mid-term, mid-single-digit margin.
francisco gomes neto
and noah, just to give you a more medium-term perspective, in our plan, we have the potential to double the revenues of the company in five years from now. we are pushing a lot for these internal programs to increase efficiency. this year, we have some growth we could see in the deliveries in the guidance, but we are still suffering some -- the impact of some extraordinary costs. so again, as soon as we overcome this difficult -- short-term, difficult, i think the perspective is very positive for the following years.
we're enjoying the growth of our revenues and the growth in the market.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
what kind of total company adjusted ebitda margin would you expect if you were to achieve that doubling of the revenue?
francisco gomes neto
noah, our dream here is to be higher single-digit margin and also cover the capital costs in the middle term and it higher single-digit market that's our dream.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
exactly.
francisco gomes neto
and i hope that you are going to see not so far in our opinion. if -- again, if you would accept of this costs that we needed to face here, we would be already in the range of 6%. 2021, we closed with 4% without the hit from brazil air force would be at above 5% already. that's why we are still facing this, i would say, impact from the past transaction with this joint venture.
and a part of it, the business is showing that resilient. and, i would say, close to above 80% in the medium term. that's our plan. that's our dream.
and we should see --
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's a ebita or ebitda number?
francisco gomes neto
ebit.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
ebit.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. ok. thank you so much.
i appreciate it.

gomes neto, who will proceed with the first remarks of 2021 fourth quarter and 2021 full year results. please go ahead, sir.
francisco gomes neto
good morning, and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter and 2021 results call today. i hope that all of you are well and safe, and i thank you for your interest in our company. before starting this conference, i would like to express our solidarity with the ukrainian people impacted by the war. what we have been following in real time causes huge consternation for all of us at embraer.
at this moment, our thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved the ones, and we support everyone who is working directly for the immediate end of this conflict in the restoration of peace in the region. as you will see later in antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were in line with our guidance, while cash generation came above expectations. the q4 and 2021 results continue to show that our strategic planning is bringing tangible positive results for the company. before we go into more financial details on the fourth quarter, i'd like to recap our key strategic pillars.
first, on growth. our commercial aviation had a rebound, and we continue with a good momentum on our executive aviation. our total backlog reached $17 billion on the back of 92 commercial jets sold being 421 and 55s. the book-to-bill for executive aviation is 2:1.
service and support was also a big focus, achieving about $2.5 billion in backlog. on defense & security, several sales campaigns are ongoing, with a big driver on industrial cooperation and strategic partnerships for future business, especially with our c-390 millennium. overall, the company's total sales reached $6.6 billion in 2021, which also contributed to cash generation with advanced payments from clients. second, enterprising efficiency.
our adjusted ebit improved over $260 million in 2021 compared to 2020, considering 11% revenue increase. higher adjusted ebit in 2021 was driven mainly by the increase in efficiency from the fit for growth strategic plan initiatives. an example was 50% improvement on inventory turn in 2021. the footprint optimization with sale of évora, [inaudible], a small plant in botucatu, the shutdown of our facilities in bradley, connecticut, and the spare parts distribution centers consolidation both in europe and in the u.s.a.
also significant contributions from our world-class procurement, production lead time, and cogs reduction projects. more importantly, this pillar has resulted in a strong evolution on free cash flow and an overall improvement in financial metrics. our financial net debt reduced by $300 million. third, innovation.
innovation is part of our history and a major driver of growth for this company. an example of this is if in the zanite signing a partnership to explore the urban air mobility business. other important investments on new segments are the turboprop new generation and e-jets freighter. future concepts on the study, like the energia family are all projects we are very excited to talk about.
last, but not least, i would like to emphasize that we have a strong culture of safety, one team spirit, and result orientation. in esg, we have many new developments. we have objective targets for the environment. we expect to reach carbon neutrality by 2040 with more efficiency in reduction on emissions as well.
we hope to use more saf, sustainable aviation fuel, and 100% renewable energy in our scope 1 plus 2. in scope 3, we hope to become net zero by 2050, developing new technologies, aircraft, 100% saff compatible and more airframe efficiency. in the social front, we also have clear targets, 50% diverse hires in all new entry-level employee programs and 20% of women in senior leadership positions by 2025, approval of more than 80% of students at embraer high schools and public universities, train people from minority groups by 2025 on the social tech program, a new professional training in technology. in governess, we have a robust ethics and compliance program, the highest international standards of governance, and very high safety standards products aligned with international requirements.
i will now hand it over to antonio to give further details on the financial results, and i will return in the end. thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thank you, francisco, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to start with the performance of our business unit. we had a great performance of our business unit despite still being in a recovery year from the pandemic. in commercial aviation, we delivered 16 jets in the fourth quarter and 48 jets in 2021, which is an increase of 9% year on year.
with the rebound of regional aviation, with 92 aircraft sold in 2021, of which 50 were 195. we are seeing strong demand recovery, especially in domestic markets. the book-to-bill for commercial aviation is 2:1. adjusted ebit margin of 0.3% and in q4 and minus 1.7% in 2021.
in executive aviation, we are excited with the performance and have delivered 39 jets in the fourth quarter, reaching 92 jets for the year. a strong backlog continues across the entire portfolio. we had a historical quarterly and yearly sales with book-to-bill ratio in excess of 2:1. adjusted ebit margin of 13.6% in q4 '21 and 8% in 2021.
another great news is that the phenom 300 has been the best-selling executive light jet in the last consecutive 10 years. continue to our defense & security unit. we have finalized an agreement with the brazilian air force, reducing total of kc-390 aircraft-s from to 28 to 22, which delivers until 2031. in q4, we had a one-time adjustment as a result of this agreement and had a backlog reduction of $526 million and noncash impact of $43 million on operational results.
we are extremely happy with our cybersecurity business, tempest. our cybersecurity company broke revenue records posting 40% growth compared to 2020 revenues. we had an adjusted ebit margin of minus 29.7% in q4 '21, 40 percentage points year on year. even considering the brazil air force agreement adjustment, we had a yearly adjusted ebit margin of 3.8% in 2021.
in services & support, the event has reached pre-pandemic levels, and we have signed more than 795 new contracts for executive aviation include inspections, aircraft enhancement, and special products. our backlog rose more than 20% in 2021 as a year-on-year basis. adjusted ebit margin of 16.7% in q4 '21, 31 percentage points year on year, and a strong annual adjusted ebit margin 14.3% in 2021. slide 7, moving to deliveries.
overall, we had a more evenly spread base of deliveries compared to 2020 because of the pandemic impact on demand. in the fourth quarter, we delivered 16 commercial jets and 39 executives jets for a total of 55 aircraft during the period. even with some supplier constraints at the end of the year, we were able to fulfill our customer expectations. the 16 deliveries in commercial aviation represents a 45% decline on a year-on-year basis, with our typical delivers amount in q4 2020 due to the pandemic.
of the 16 deliveries, 12 were 175 and 4 e2s. we have started to see higher sales momentum for both e1 and e2 family of commercial aircraft, which is a positive news. we have delivered in 2021, 48 aircraft, which is we framed our 2021 guidance of 45 to 50 aircrafts. executive aviation delivered 20 light jets and 13 large jets for a total 39 aircrafts in the fourth quarter.
the deliveries in q4 represents a 10% decline year-on-year basis due to the same reasons as commercial aviation. overall, we have delivered in 2021, 93 jets, which is also within our guidance of 90 to 95 aircraft in 2021. in slide 8, we start with our backlog. we ended the fourth quarter with a backlog of $17 billion, reaching its highest value since the second quarter of 2018.
that is 18% increase with $2.6 billion addition year on year. turning to net revenue. fourth quarter net revenue was $1.3 billion, down 41% year on year. this year-on-year decrease is due to the pandemic impact in 2020, which concentrated delivers enhance revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus a more normalized delivery flow is spread out in the year for 2021.
net revenue in 2021 was $4.2 billion, up 11% from last year. we had a solid revenue growth as all business units posted higher revenue compared to 2020 except for defense. in commercial and executive aviation, we had better sales mix and more aircraft delivered 2021. in services & support, we had the overall positive revenue contribution increasing for all segments.
important to note that 92% of our total revenue comes from export, which shows our global outreach. overall, we reached 2021 guidance with net revenue within the $4 billion and $4.5 billion range. moving on to adjusted ebit and ebitda, we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in margin performance for the company. for the fourth quarter, on a consolidated basis, our adjusted ebit margin was 4.3%, and our adjusted ebitda margin was 8.2%, an increase of 0.1 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points on a year-on-year basis, respectively.
on a yearly basis, adjusted ebit margin was 4% and adjusted ebitda at 8.6%, both well above last year and within our outlook range of 3% to 4% for adjusted ebit and 8.5% to 9.5% adjusted ebitda for 2021. on a dollar basis, adjusted ebit was $167 million, compared to a loss of $111 million in 2020. and adjusted ebitda was $363 million, compared to $82 million in 2020. our ebit would have been better if we did not have additional costs that are treated at corporate level related to integration and ongoing arbitration costs.
this improvement in ebit and ebitda are results of our fit for growth initiatives. slide 10 look at sg&a. sg&a, as a whole, continues to trend favorably over the past years. yearly sg&a down $360 million or 23% decline compared to 2019 figures.
selling expenses were down from $256 million to $230 million due to our focus on more cost-effective ways to reach our customers. general and administrative expenses were up from $143 million to $153 million in 2021. it's important to note that we remain highly focused on sg&a efficiencies and apply linked principles to it. on investment, we have a more normalized level in 2021, with a 20% increase in combined in both capex and r&d.
we continue to optimize our capital allocation, including divestitures and program prioritization. in slide 11, i'd like first to highlight our remarkable recovery. adjusted free cash flow in 2021 was $292 billion. this is well above our $100 billion or better outlook, more efficient inventory management better production planning and stronger sales, and executive and commercial aviation, and the down payments associated with these sales have led to our positive cash flow for the year.
adjusted net result was a loss of $29 million or $0.24 per ads. although negative, net results is trending up, driven primarily by revenue growth. and as our top line grows, our fixed cost leverage and financial level will improve, providing additional positive impact on earnings. furthermore, the company is targeting a positive net results for 2022 onwards.
this next slide show our cash and cash equivalents position. we ended the year with $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents. our total debt at the end of 2020 $4 billion, with a net debt of $1.4 billion. we reduced $300 million debt in 2021.
it's important to highlight that our net debt ebitda ratio decreased from 5.6 times to 3.5 times in 2021. this is a 2.1 times decline in just two years. our average debt to maturity decreased to 3.7 years. we remain focused on generating cash, reduce our debt levels and improve our credit metrics.
with our recent bond maturing in 2020 to '23, buyback of $289 billion. with that, our average debt maturity increased above four years. i will now guide you through our outlook for 2022 without eve. we have an increased our range of deliveries for 2022 due to the uncertainties that we are seeing in recent events.
we are working very closely with our suppliers to overcome the liquidity challenge situation. for commercial aviation, we forecast 60 to 70 aircrafts, and for executive, 100 to 110 jets deliveries. for revenue, we forecast $4.5 billion to $5 billion. for adjusted ebit margin, 3.5% to 4.5%.
for adjusted ebitda margin 8% to 9%. and for free cash flow, we forecast $50 million or better. with that, i conclude my presentation and hand it back to francisco for his final remarks. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto
thanks, antonio. the fourth quarter and year-end results reinforce our confidence in our strategy. before we do a quick recap, i would like to briefly highlight about our urban air mobility eve. the listing at new york stock exchange in closing is expected for this second quarter with total investments of about $500 million, which includes spec and strategic investors.
the anticipated pro forma enterprise value is $2.4 billion. eve has the strategic support from embraer, with access to infrastructure, extensive aircraft certification, and manufacturing experience, and already established global network of services and support, intellectual property, and engineers as major differentiators from other projects. finally, we have strategic partners such as skywest, republic airways, bae systems, rolls-royce, azorra, fond thales who know very well our capabilities. i think it is also important to mention that the russia-ukraine conflict should not bring supply disruption in the midterm because we have worked on stocking some strategic items.
our 2022 guidance shows another positive free cash flow for the full year based on the good momentum of the company with a mix of recovery and growth, keeping our strong focus on the top line and higher profitability. we hope to deliver net profit in 2022. we also expect that our strategic projects generate free cash flow so they can finance their growth. on liability, we seek the best capital structure with liquidity enhanced.
finally, our focus are our pillars of growth, efficiency, innovation, and esg, safety first, result-oriented culture, and one team spirit. thank you to our great team for their focus and passion on creating disruptive and sustainable technologies and executing our strategic planning. and thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.

we will now start a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] to give everyone a chance to participate, we request to ask just one question per call. our first question comes from myles walton, ubs.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is lou raffetto on for myles. hello?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
hello.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
how are you? can you hear me?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes, we can.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
all right. great. i just wanted to check on free cash flow, you guys mentioned was the best in over 10 years. how do we think about that the rest of the year? it seems like a very strong start.
is there anything else that you guys see over the next couple of quarters before your seasonally strong fourth quarter?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
well, thanks for the questions. antonio speaking here. i think it's a great question. we have a good start for sure.
and that's why when we said the guidance, we said $50 million-plus or better. and what -- we do see a positive trend, yes. we don't know the magnitude of how much we are talking about to be better, but we should be more precise in the second quarter. but for sure, that trend is highly positive with the good start.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and then the other expense line, obviously, there's a lot going on in there.
you took out the $9 million of eve expense. there's this other $17 million in there. how do we think about that line the rest of the year?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. for eve, everything we are showing in our numbers, we just have the portion of embraer and eve. we hope and we expect and we are going to do it with the listing in the new york stock exchange, then the product become a different dynamic in our results because we are going to -- on the eve, yes we need to capitalize those expenses most part of it. and then we are going also to update our guidance including eve, which is from one side is going to boost the cash flow, but it's also going to impact a little bit the ebit side.
so as soon we close the transaction, then we are going to revise also the guidance. but we do not see a discontinuation. but we do not have also in our numbers today, eve embedded only the $9 million that we are seeing at adjusted ebit with the adjustments because the company is still operating and we are going to revise it in q2.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and i guess when i think of those other nonrecurring costs, you said that had arbitration, as well as the reintegration. so i would guess the reintegration costs go away and that sort of nonrecurring will continue, but at a lower rate than the $17 million?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yeah. probably, yes. we, for sure, starting q2 onwards, we do not have much more cost for the integration then we're still keeping with the arbitration costs that we are not adjusting. we will see the magnitude of the number that should be more or less on this level, a little bit less from the coming quarters, ok? and please, when you do your math, adjust your calculation.
this number, we are not adjusting because of confidentiality, but you have more or less the magnitude than there is, in my opinion, this $17 million that we are seeing right now should be more or less in this range for the coming quarters. we do not see exceed on this cost, maybe a little bit reduction. [inaudible]
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.

our next question comes from mariana perez mora, bank of america.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. so, for the first question --
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
good morning, mariana.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
can you please discuss how sustainable are these margins on per like segments? and how they compare to your targeted margins like, call it, like three to five years from now?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes, mariana. we -- i would say the margins we are seeing per segment for sure. we should see in the long term. we are still away from, i would say, executive and service, we are more or less in the level we do see for the future.
but we do have -- still have to improve in defense and commercial here to the same level of the others. it's more or less in a long-term perspective, what we are seeing right now. we are in the recovery mode for the commercial aviation. and we still have something to do in defense.
and most probably, defense is going to recover faster because we are going to see significant improvements start from 2023 onwards. commercial aviation is going to take a little bit more time in order to the new company starts showing up better, i would say, gross margin performance as we have with the old contracts. that's more or less in a nutshell where i see right now all business units come to this level in the midterm.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. can you discuss what's the customers' interest, how your conversations are going? and how last this demand? and then also, what are you seeing in the services side?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
could you please repeat your questions? there was some noise in the line, and we're not able to --
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sure. so, on executives, could you please give us some color on the demand going forward? how your conversations with customers are going on? and how sustainable do you think is this like really strong demand for executives that we are seeing so far?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i think the sales -- our sales in q1 is showing us that the demand continues is strong. we sold 35 aircraft in q1. i mean the highest in the past almost six years.
we had -- only in 2016, q1, we saw the 36 aircraft in that quarter. so it's a good sign for us. we -- yes, we believe we are going to have some changes in the future, but we believe in a soft landing in the market. and we are seeing a lot of our first-time buyers in this segment and the interest in the small and medium-sized jets, exactly where we have our portfolio of products.
so again, we are still confident that this market will continue to be strong during the next two or three years at least.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. and then last one from me on defense. you mentioned foreign interest and strong international interest. could you please give us some color or like try to quantify that interest?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
mariana, we do not disclosure the volumes, especially in that segment. but what we can see is that, yes, we are having a lot of customers, i mean, coming to us and asking for deliveries opportunities in short and medium term. and which was a change that we believe was because of the situation in europe between russia and ukraine. so again, good opportunities for us for our products, the c-390 millennium and the a-29 super tucano in short and medium term.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

you mentioned in the presentation that in commercial aviation, you have some key active campaigns in progress. and then also, you mentioned in the presentation, the increased interest for the c-390 and for the super tucano. could you just comment a little bit of when you would expect new orders to come out? so would you expect more orders to be announced over the second half of this year? or is it something that maybe will take place in 2023? so any color you could give on the timing that you would expect new orders to come out. that would be very helpful.
thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thank you, lucas. well, for the commercial aviation, we expect new awards during this year. and the defense and mix between 2022 and 2023.

stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
thank you, everybody. and good morning, and thank you for taking my question. when i think about the order activity or the order potential on the commercial aviation side, do you have any high-level view with respect to where we could see the order activity come from a geographic perspective? are you guys seeing anything in, for example, a potential scope clause adjustment in the u.s.? or are you seeing maybe somewhat better order potential coming from emerging markets? thank you.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. well, specifically in the commercial aviation, we -- i mentioned that we are working in several sales campaigns that we believe are because of the domestic air travel recover. and also some decisions on fleet renewal to new-generation aircraft, especially where our product, our e2 family is well-positioned because of the efficiency compared to all the aircraft. also, we launched a project to convert any passenger jets into freighters that we believe will -- the idea is to export a good opportunity as the global air cargo is growing up to 12% this year versus 2019.
so -- and then there is a strong demand for e-jets freighters as the market wants now to receive the goods, i mean in the next day or even the same day. so that we see good opportunities for our e-jet freighters. and last, i mean, the scope clause, we don't see any changes in the short term in the next, i don't know, at least the five, six years. so we -- which is a good opportunity for us to continue selling our e1 family, e175 ones.

our next question comes from noah poponak, goldman sachs.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
hello, noah.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. what's your expectation for book-to-bill for the year at commercial?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
our expectation is to keep the same level we saw last year of 2-to-1.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. good to know. what is in the full year revenue guidance for the defense segment at this point?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
noah, it's antonio speaking here. we do have, for defense, around $600 million. that's pretty weak this year for defense.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then, you know, i guess maybe could you speak a little bit to your thinking on the medium- to long-term growth rate in that business from here. i mean, it's been quite choppy for a while from this lower level of revenue. what's your -- how are you seeing that play out?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
well, noah, francisco speaking out. yes, we see a tough year this year for defense, as antonio said. so we are working on several initiatives to improve the performance of that unit already in 2023. and the new market environment will help us a lot, not only in 2023, but in the years ahead with the high -- with the highest interest in the in the c-390 millennium, that is a product with a very high value added.
so we expect it to reach soon to be back to $1 billion in revenues in our defense unit.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. great. and then on free cash, can you maybe just speak a little bit to the -- your expectation of the sequencing through the year just given the working capital in the first quarter. the working capital change in the first quarter is different than it's been in the first quarter for a while here.
so it sounds like the shape of the year is fairly different than it's been.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the questions, antonio speaking here. and thanks also for recognize our efforts. as i try to speak to the market, we are growing revenue, but we are improving the working capital at the same time.
and the trend is to become positive in next quarters to come, right? we do not have a spike on the negative side to go again. we have the cash steering process we control on a daily basis. and that's why we are quite confident that the quarters to come will be positive and to a point that we probably are going to revise our cash guidance in q2 because we said $50 million or better. now we are evaluating how better we could be.
noah poponak -- goldman sachs -- analyst

thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thank you, josh, for the question. the turboprop project is moving very well. we are now in the phase to define a supplier for this aircraft. we are doing tests already, i mean, with the concept.
so it's moving very well. we expect to be ready to make a final decision on the business case by the end of the year, beginning of 2023. and no, the investments, we are keeping the investments for this year. so we will not stop the development activities during this year.
and we are working in parallel on how to fund this program since we approved the business case by, again, end of this year, q1 next year.

please go ahead, sir.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2022 results call today. i hope that all of you are well and safe, and i thank you for your interest in our company. the first quarter results continue to show that our planned execution and company turnaround remains underway, and our focus to drive innovation and enterprise efficiency are key pillars to our growth strategy. as you will see later in antonio's presentation, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and our numbers show that even with a shutdown of our operations during the month of january to integrate the commercial revision systems, we were able to deliver solid results.
before we go into more financial details on the first quarter, i'd like to give you some quick highlights of our key actions. first, on innovation. eve's closing is expected in may. the listing at the new york stock exchange will accelerate and bring innovation to the new renewable air mobility ecosystem.
speaking about our innovation pipeline, we have several ongoing projects such as zero or low carbon emission and airframe efficiency. second, enterprise efficiency. we're continuing to work with great focus and discipline on improving efficiency in all business units in our administrative areas and operations, applying lean principles and continuous improvement culture to several processes. our financial performance continues to trend up with the best free cash flow in a first quarter since 2010.
as mentioned previously, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, even with a challenging supply chain due to the war in ukraine and shortages of products worldwide. on the next slide, we will talk about growth and see more details of business units highlights in the quarter. in commercial aviation, we have several ongoing campaigns, mainly due to steadily rebound of domestic flights in the u.s.a. and europe.
the oil price increase also reinforces the relevance of the e2 family as the most efficient narrow-body in fuel consumption. executive aviation keeps up the good momentum with sales orders exceeding prior-year levels and backlog increased above 12% in q1 '22 versus q4 '21. on defense, we have seen an increased interest in c-390 millennium and a-29 super tucano from several countries recently. we expect an acceleration in sales campaigns for these products.
services and support has grown above pre-pandemic levels with a growing backlog and positive gross margin versus last year. deliveries of aircraft in the first quarter were slightly below expectations, mainly due to approximately 30-day shutdown, which i have commented earlier on. i will now hand it over to antonio to give further details on the financial results, and i will return in the end. thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, francisco, and good morning, everyone. let's give some highlights of the first quarter 2022 financial results. by the way, a quarter with 60 days activity for the third quarter. let's get started on slide 5.
first of all, we are reaffirming all aspects of our 2022 financial and delivery guidance with no material variation. the brand delivered 14 jets in the first quarter, of which six commercial aircraft and eight executive jets. six light jets and two mid-sized jets, all of this according to our schedule. deliveries in the quarter were negatively impacted by almost one-month shutdown in january 2022 due to the commercial aviation system and legal integration.
third order backlog ended the first quarter 2022 at $17.3 billion, plus $300 million versus q4 2021. this is the highest quarter backlog since the second quarter 2018, driven by solid sales activity. on the revenue side, revenue reached $601 million in the quarter down 26% compared to the first quarter '21, with almost one-month production shutdown in january. in contrast, reported consolidated gross margin of 20% was higher than the 9.5% reported in the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to the better performance in all business units.
on slide 6, adjusted ebit and ebitda. even with the less 26% revenue and higher sg&a compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted ebit and ebitda margin were $27 million negative and $13.2 million positive, respectively, building adjusted ebit margin of minus 4.5% and adjusted ebitda margin of positive 2.2%. adjusted ebit q1 2022 also includes nonrecurring expenses like commercial aviation integration process, arbitration process, and others of $17 million. if we exclude all of extraordinary effects, adjusted ebit margin would have been minus $1.7 million or minus $10 million for us.
and ebitda margin of 5% or $30 million positive. complementing our strategy to mitigate exchange risks through the cash flow hedging, we recognized credit of $800,000 related to payroll expenses in the first quarter 2022. at least, we do see a limited fx impact for this fiscal year in our results between brazilian reals and u.s. dollar basis.
moving to slide 7, let's start with g&a. -- as a whole continues to trend favorably over the past years. quarterly sg&a reached $95 million, or an increase of $15 million compared to the first quarter '21 figures. due to more activity on the sales side, campaigns impacting expenses as well the uptick corporate and administrative expenses driven by inflation.
it's important to say that we remain highly focused on sg&a efficiency. on investments, in q1 2022, embraer invested a total of $39 million in product development and research mainly related to e2 commercial jet program, and $9 million capex. it's important to mention, we continue to invest in our future with highly disciplined capex allocation. another good news.
let's go to slide no. 8. starting with adjusted free cash flow. in regards to our free cash flow, the company continued highly focused to improve the cash steering process.
free cash flow in first quarter 2022 was a usage of $68 million, representing a significant improvement compared to the $227 million negative in the first quarter of 2021, consistent with working optimization measures and enterprise efficiency. working capital had a positive impact in the company overall cash performance even considering the seasonality of the business, delivering its best first quarter cash since 2010. the main highlights were optimized inventory management and higher advanced payments from customers compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. on the adjusted net results, was a loss of $79 million, although negative, we do see net results trending up, driven by revenue growth in the last quarters.
fixed cost leverage, reduction in interest costs due to our liability management activities, and the full tax efficiency that we get back from the legal integration of commercial aviation. all of these effects together, will provide an additional positive impact in earnings for this fiscal year. so let's move it to slide no. 9, liquidity.
the company finished the quarter with a total debt of $3.5 billion or $500 million less than q4 2021, in line with our strategy, and net debt of $1.5 billion. embraer continues to deleverage the balance sheet, reducing systematically the gross debt and improve the credit metrics, and we do expect to reduce the interest expenses with that. it's important to highlight that our net-debt-to-ebitda ratio is around 3.7 times in first quarter of 2022, and we really remain focused on generating cash and reducing our debt levels. with that, i conclude my presentation and hand over back to francisco for his final remarks.
thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thanks, antonio. to close, i'd like to briefly highlight our urban air mobility, eve. the listing at the new york stock exchange and closing is expected for the next month in may, with total investments of about $500 million, which includes spec and strategic investors. eve has a strategic support from embraer with access to infrastructure, extensive aircraft certification, and manufacturing experience.
and already established global network of services and support of lead engineers as major differentiators from other projects. finally, we have strategic partners such as skywest, republic airways, bae systems, rolls royce, azorra, acciona, falko, and thales, who know very well our capabilities. thank you to our great team for their focus and passion for creating innovation and executing our strategic advantage. and thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.

we will now start a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] to give everyone a chance to participate, we request to ask just one question per call. our first question comes from myles walton, ubs.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is lou raffetto on for myles. hello?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
hello.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
how are you? can you hear me?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes, we can.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
all right. great. i just wanted to check on free cash flow, you guys mentioned was the best in over 10 years. how do we think about that the rest of the year? it seems like a very strong start.
is there anything else that you guys see over the next couple of quarters before your seasonally strong fourth quarter?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
well, thanks for the questions. antonio speaking here. i think it's a great question. we have a good start for sure.
and that's why when we said the guidance, we said $50 million-plus or better. and what -- we do see a positive trend, yes. we don't know the magnitude of how much we are talking about to be better, but we should be more precise in the second quarter. but for sure, that trend is highly positive with the good start.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. and then the other expense line, obviously, there's a lot going on in there.
you took out the $9 million of eve expense. there's this other $17 million in there. how do we think about that line the rest of the year?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes. for eve, everything we are showing in our numbers, we just have the portion of embraer and eve. we hope and we expect and we are going to do it with the listing in the new york stock exchange, then the product become a different dynamic in our results because we are going to -- on the eve, yes we need to capitalize those expenses most part of it. and then we are going also to update our guidance including eve, which is from one side is going to boost the cash flow, but it's also going to impact a little bit the ebit side.
so as soon we close the transaction, then we are going to revise also the guidance. but we do not see a discontinuation. but we do not have also in our numbers today, eve embedded only the $9 million that we are seeing at adjusted ebit with the adjustments because the company is still operating and we are going to revise it in q2.
lou raffetto -- ubs -- analyst
ok. and i guess when i think of those other nonrecurring costs, you said that had arbitration, as well as the reintegration. so i would guess the reintegration costs go away and that sort of nonrecurring will continue, but at a lower rate than the $17 million?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yeah. probably, yes. we, for sure, starting q2 onwards, we do not have much more cost for the integration then we're still keeping with the arbitration costs that we are not adjusting. we will see the magnitude of the number that should be more or less on this level, a little bit less from the coming quarters, ok? and please, when you do your math, adjust your calculation.
this number, we are not adjusting because of confidentiality, but you have more or less the magnitude than there is, in my opinion, this $17 million that we are seeing right now should be more or less in this range for the coming quarters. we do not see exceed on this cost, maybe a little bit reduction. [inaudible]

our next question comes from mariana perez mora, bank of america.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. so, for the first question --
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
good morning, mariana.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
can you please discuss how sustainable are these margins on per like segments? and how they compare to your targeted margins like, call it, like three to five years from now?
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
yes, mariana. we -- i would say the margins we are seeing per segment for sure. we should see in the long term. we are still away from, i would say, executive and service, we are more or less in the level we do see for the future.
but we do have -- still have to improve in defense and commercial here to the same level of the others. it's more or less in a long-term perspective, what we are seeing right now. we are in the recovery mode for the commercial aviation. and we still have something to do in defense.
and most probably, defense is going to recover faster because we are going to see significant improvements start from 2023 onwards. commercial aviation is going to take a little bit more time in order to the new company starts showing up better, i would say, gross margin performance as we have with the old contracts. that's more or less in a nutshell where i see right now all business units come to this level in the midterm.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. can you discuss what's the customers' interest, how your conversations are going? and how last this demand? and then also, what are you seeing in the services side?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
could you please repeat your questions? there was some noise in the line, and we're not able to --
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
sure. so, on executives, could you please give us some color on the demand going forward? how your conversations with customers are going on? and how sustainable do you think is this like really strong demand for executives that we are seeing so far?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i think the sales -- our sales in q1 is showing us that the demand continues is strong. we sold 35 aircraft in q1. i mean the highest in the past almost six years.
we had -- only in 2016, q1, we saw the 36 aircraft in that quarter. so it's a good sign for us. we -- yes, we believe we are going to have some changes in the future, but we believe in a soft landing in the market. and we are seeing a lot of our first-time buyers in this segment and the interest in the small and medium-sized jets, exactly where we have our portfolio of products.
so again, we are still confident that this market will continue to be strong during the next two or three years at least.
mariana perez mora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. and then last one from me on defense. you mentioned foreign interest and strong international interest. could you please give us some color or like try to quantify that interest?
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
mariana, we do not disclosure the volumes, especially in that segment. but what we can see is that, yes, we are having a lot of customers, i mean, coming to us and asking for deliveries opportunities in short and medium term. and which was a change that we believe was because of the situation in europe between russia and ukraine. so again, good opportunities for us for our products, the c-390 millennium and the a-29 super tucano in short and medium term.

and we are working in parallel on how to fund this program since we approved the business case by, again, end of this year, q1 next year.

please go ahead, sir.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you all for joining our first quarter 2022 results call today. i hope that all of you are well and safe, and i thank you for your interest in our company. the first quarter results continue to show that our planned execution and company turnaround remains underway, and our focus to drive innovation and enterprise efficiency are key pillars to our growth strategy. as you will see later in antonio's presentation, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, and our numbers show that even with a shutdown of our operations during the month of january to integrate the commercial revision systems, we were able to deliver solid results.
before we go into more financial details on the first quarter, i'd like to give you some quick highlights of our key actions. first, on innovation. eve's closing is expected in may. the listing at the new york stock exchange will accelerate and bring innovation to the new renewable air mobility ecosystem.
speaking about our innovation pipeline, we have several ongoing projects such as zero or low carbon emission and airframe efficiency. second, enterprise efficiency. we're continuing to work with great focus and discipline on improving efficiency in all business units in our administrative areas and operations, applying lean principles and continuous improvement culture to several processes. our financial performance continues to trend up with the best free cash flow in a first quarter since 2010.
as mentioned previously, we are maintaining our guidance for the year, even with a challenging supply chain due to the war in ukraine and shortages of products worldwide. on the next slide, we will talk about growth and see more details of business units highlights in the quarter. in commercial aviation, we have several ongoing campaigns, mainly due to steadily rebound of domestic flights in the u.s.a. and europe.
the oil price increase also reinforces the relevance of the e2 family as the most efficient narrow-body in fuel consumption. executive aviation keeps up the good momentum with sales orders exceeding prior-year levels and backlog increased above 12% in q1 '22 versus q4 '21. on defense, we have seen an increased interest in c-390 millennium and a-29 super tucano from several countries recently. we expect an acceleration in sales campaigns for these products.
services and support has grown above pre-pandemic levels with a growing backlog and positive gross margin versus last year. deliveries of aircraft in the first quarter were slightly below expectations, mainly due to approximately 30-day shutdown, which i have commented earlier on. i will now hand it over to antonio to give further details on the financial results, and i will return in the end. thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, francisco, and good morning, everyone. let's give some highlights of the first quarter 2022 financial results. by the way, a quarter with 60 days activity for the third quarter. let's get started on slide 5.
first of all, we are reaffirming all aspects of our 2022 financial and delivery guidance with no material variation. the brand delivered 14 jets in the first quarter, of which six commercial aircraft and eight executive jets. six light jets and two mid-sized jets, all of this according to our schedule. deliveries in the quarter were negatively impacted by almost one-month shutdown in january 2022 due to the commercial aviation system and legal integration.
third order backlog ended the first quarter 2022 at $17.3 billion, plus $300 million versus q4 2021. this is the highest quarter backlog since the second quarter 2018, driven by solid sales activity. on the revenue side, revenue reached $601 million in the quarter down 26% compared to the first quarter '21, with almost one-month production shutdown in january. in contrast, reported consolidated gross margin of 20% was higher than the 9.5% reported in the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to the better performance in all business units.
on slide 6, adjusted ebit and ebitda. even with the less 26% revenue and higher sg&a compared to the first quarter of 2021, adjusted ebit and ebitda margin were $27 million negative and $13.2 million positive, respectively, building adjusted ebit margin of minus 4.5% and adjusted ebitda margin of positive 2.2%. adjusted ebit q1 2022 also includes nonrecurring expenses like commercial aviation integration process, arbitration process, and others of $17 million. if we exclude all of extraordinary effects, adjusted ebit margin would have been minus $1.7 million or minus $10 million for us.
and ebitda margin of 5% or $30 million positive. complementing our strategy to mitigate exchange risks through the cash flow hedging, we recognized credit of $800,000 related to payroll expenses in the first quarter 2022. at least, we do see a limited fx impact for this fiscal year in our results between brazilian reals and u.s. dollar basis.
moving to slide 7, let's start with g&a. -- as a whole continues to trend favorably over the past years. quarterly sg&a reached $95 million, or an increase of $15 million compared to the first quarter '21 figures. due to more activity on the sales side, campaigns impacting expenses as well the uptick corporate and administrative expenses driven by inflation.
it's important to say that we remain highly focused on sg&a efficiency. on investments, in q1 2022, embraer invested a total of $39 million in product development and research mainly related to e2 commercial jet program, and $9 million capex. it's important to mention, we continue to invest in our future with highly disciplined capex allocation. another good news.
let's go to slide no. 8. starting with adjusted free cash flow. in regards to our free cash flow, the company continued highly focused to improve the cash steering process.
free cash flow in first quarter 2022 was a usage of $68 million, representing a significant improvement compared to the $227 million negative in the first quarter of 2021, consistent with working optimization measures and enterprise efficiency. working capital had a positive impact in the company overall cash performance even considering the seasonality of the business, delivering its best first quarter cash since 2010. the main highlights were optimized inventory management and higher advanced payments from customers compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. on the adjusted net results, was a loss of $79 million, although negative, we do see net results trending up, driven by revenue growth in the last quarters.
fixed cost leverage, reduction in interest costs due to our liability management activities, and the full tax efficiency that we get back from the legal integration of commercial aviation. all of these effects together, will provide an additional positive impact in earnings for this fiscal year. so let's move it to slide no. 9, liquidity.
the company finished the quarter with a total debt of $3.5 billion or $500 million less than q4 2021, in line with our strategy, and net debt of $1.5 billion. embraer continues to deleverage the balance sheet, reducing systematically the gross debt and improve the credit metrics, and we do expect to reduce the interest expenses with that. it's important to highlight that our net-debt-to-ebitda ratio is around 3.7 times in first quarter of 2022, and we really remain focused on generating cash and reducing our debt levels. with that, i conclude my presentation and hand over back to francisco for his final remarks.
thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thanks, antonio. to close, i'd like to briefly highlight our urban air mobility, eve. the listing at the new york stock exchange and closing is expected for the next month in may, with total investments of about $500 million, which includes spec and strategic investors. eve has a strategic support from embraer with access to infrastructure, extensive aircraft certification, and manufacturing experience.
and already established global network of services and support of lead engineers as major differentiators from other projects. finally, we have strategic partners such as skywest, republic airways, bae systems, rolls royce, azorra, acciona, falko, and thales, who know very well our capabilities. thank you to our great team for their focus and passion for creating innovation and executing our strategic advantage. and thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.

and the first one is if you could just update us on the financial -- on its financial impact for this year. and if i'm not mistaken, you had talked about a potential $50 million effect this year that would be expense recognized in the pnl for the year as a whole. so i just wanted to kind of clarify if in fact, that's how it's been treated and if that's roughly still the magnitude of the impact you expect. and then i was also just hoping you could give us a little bit of your updated thinking on the project and maybe just touch base on what steps remain for it to be greenlighted, what kind of buy in you're looking for -- buy in you're looking for from customers and whether having a jv partner would be critical? thank you very much.
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
hello, josh. antonio speaking. thanks for the request. i just want to answer part of it.
firstly, what we are seeing regards to impact on our financial performance this year for the [inaudible] is around $25 million. we are working hard in order to minimize because we are still not capitalizing those r&d costs. but for the profit and loss, this year is $25 million and is a red part of our forecast and also our guidance.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
josh, francisco speaking. about the project, i like to say that we are very excited with this project. we are progressing well on tests, wing test, and all the engineering activities. we expect to to decide about the engine selection in the second half of the year.
and we expect to approve the business case beginning of next year. and also even not having the business case approve it, we announced the last time in may -- last month in farnborough airshow, that we have already 250 letter of intent -- 250 plus letter of intent of customers in our tp models.
josh milberg -- morgan stanley -- analyst

marcelo motta -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. it's a question regarding the deliveries. during the presentation, embraer commented that around four aircraft in the commercial aviation were not delivered due to supply chain issues.
so just want to know if the company could provide additional color regarding if it was like part, the engine, the reasons behind this delay. and if those parts are ready deliver now at the beginning of august and if there is any other aircraft that is delay as of now. thank you.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
marcelo, thanks for your question. it's highly appropriate. and i wouldn't use the opportunity to say more than you ask me and you ask us here. for sure, the -- what the [inaudible] said most is normal is changing avionics in order, small parts.
they are concentrating four or five suppliers. and that was the beginning of the year. maybe you will recall this when we set the guidance and the market reacted quite the negative. it should be on us all overreact when they said 60 to 70 aircrafts, 100, 200 executive jets because at that time we foresee the [inaudible] type situation that we are living.
and that's why people are getting sicker with the supply chain. but for embraer, we saw this some months ago is not a surprise. but finalizing the question through the different graphs, there are going to be delivery right now in the month of august.

good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. i'm curious, when we think about supply chain issues, do you see any scope for embraer to maybe undertake some small acquisitions if you need it to secure critical supply? i did ask the same question of your canadian competitor earlier this morning. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
ok. francisco speaking. at this moment -- hello. at this moment that we are working very close to our supply chain.
very close. we have a small army of people. i mean, the insides of the operations of our suppliers, of our service suppliers, of our sub suppliers. but we don't have any plans to acquire any supply as a strategy to resolve this problem.
we do believe we can resolve this with a closer collaboration with our suppliers partners.
unknown speaker
ok. great. and i apologize for all the background noise. just one very quick follow up, if i may.
can you remind me whether you have any supply at this juncture coming from the russian federation? and that's it for me. thank you.

so i'm trying to speak to here. we only have one supplier from russia is titanium that we are partially already replacing by us and european suppliers. or some months ago we were at 85% buying demand in russia for titanium. now we are already below 60 and our plan is really to try to eliminate the source of the raw material.

good morning, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2022 results call today. i hope that all of you are well and safe. and i thank you for your interest in our company. the second quarter results show a steady improvement in our financial results with our focus and discipline in the execution of our growth plan.
despite the challenging supply chain environment, which i will talk more about later, we were able to deliver solid results. and we have always maintained our focus on enterprise efficiency and innovation as key pillars of our growth strategy. we reached a fewer order backlog of $17.8 billion in the second quarter 2022, the highest level since the beginning of the pandemic. this number does not consider orders new order announced during the farnborough airshow last month.
and we are pleased to announce it reported adjusted net income of $39.4 million in this quarter. before we go into more financial details on the quarter, i'd like to give you some quick highlights on our two key pillars. first on innovation. it is like you brought $377 million of gross proceeds, which will be used to accelerate the development, simplification, and commercialization of our urban air mobility solution.
during the farnborough airshow, we've announced [inaudible] aviation as a launch customer for urban air traffic management solution. at the event, we also unveiled eve top cabin mockup and updated the product design. second, enterprise efficiency. we continue to work with great discipline to be more efficient at a vary company.
this quarter, we announced a partnership with toyota to maximize efficiency in our production and accelerate the use of lead principles to reduce the production cycle lead time of our aircraft by 40% by the end of 2023. mainly due to our efficient initiatives, the financial performance continues to improve. free cash flow increased 100% versus the second quarter last year in our gross margin presented a substantial increase compared to the same period last year. on the next slide, we will speak about our main esg achievements announced in the second quarter.
embraer releases -- send a letter of intent with a commitment to develop sustainable aviation fuel production ecosystem. embraer will become the first aircraft manufacture to use saf that will be distributed by hastings, a global leader in bioenergy. we also announced a new purchase agreement to source 100% renewable energy in brazil by 2024, a year ahead of our 2025 target. embraer and pratt & whitney had successfully tested a e195-e2 aircraft on 100% sustainable aviation fuel this quarter.
finally, our annual 2021 report was published in may. the report brings the main highlights of the year on innovation, financial performance, and a complete overview of embraer's esg actions in 2021. important to note that our report is already inside the framework friendly foreign investors in our company. the next slide, we would talk about growth and see more details of business unit highlights in the quarter.
in commercial aviation during the farnborough airshow, we announced a few order of 20 e195-e2 from porter airlines, now totaling 50 orders and 50 options, and an additional eight e175-e1 from order from alaska air. on the [inaudible] passenger to freighter project is signing a few order for up to ten aircraft for an undisclosed customer, and an [inaudible] for 10 freighters. gross margin of 13.2% in q2 '22 versus 4.5% in the previous year. executive aviation keeps up with momentum strong sales.
we delivered 21 jets, being 12 light and nine large. backlog increase above 16% compared to the previous quarter in gross margin of 22%, compared to 17.5% in the previous year. on defense, we are very pleased to have received in june the netherlands ministry of defense decision to select the c-390 millennium as the sole source to replace its cargo fleet. it is a clear demonstration of the increase in interest in our aircraft from several countries recently.
gross margin of 28% in q2 '22 versus 34.6% in the previous year. serves and support continues to improve its results, with a stable backlog and positive gross margin, which reaches almost 32% in q2 2022 versus 28% in the same period of 2021. they also signing a new contract with lot polish, expanding the pool program to cover 44 aircraft. i will now hand it over to antonio to give further details on the financial results, and i will return it in.
thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, francisco, and good morning, everyone. let's talk about financial results. we deliver a stronger results in the second quarter. reinforcing our confidence in our financial performance for the year.
we continue highly focused in our pillars of deleverage the company, driving profitability and efficiency. embraer delivered 32 jets in the second quarter, of which 11 commercial aircraft and 21 executive jets, 12 large jets and nine mid-size jets, according to our schedule. we reaffirm all aspects of our 2022 financial and deliveries guidance with no material variation. deliveries is a good base and seasonally concentrated in the second half of the year.
we have noticed some concern from the sell side reports about deliveries for the year. but just as a reminder, we are today just four aircrafts in commercial aviation behind [inaudible]. despite the very challenging supply scenario, our plans have not changed, and we remain confident in the delivery of the aircrafts. [inaudible] order backlog ended second quarter 2022 at $17.8 billion, half billion more versus first quarter 2022.
this is the highest quarter backlog since beginning of the pandemic, 12% higher, driven by solid sales activities. revenues reached $1.90 billion in the quarter, down 10% compared to the second quarter of '21, due to lower deliveries in commercial and defense segments, partially offset by our service and support business unit. before starting with ebit and ebitda, i want to mention that we reported consolidated gross margin of 21.9% in the quarter was higher than the 18.2% reported in the second quarter of previous year '21. we find year-over-year profit in most segments due to the product and service mix pricing and overall operational performance, including tax efficiencies.
adjusted ebit and ebitda were $81 million and $125 million respectively using adjusted ebit margin of 8% and adjusted ebitda margin of 12.2%. it's important that you mention that our adjusted ebit in second quarter '22 also includes commercial aviation integration and arbitration expenses of around $60.5 million. if we exclude all these extraordinary effects, adjusted ebit margin would have to be our odds 10% or $100 million in the second quarter '22. and ebitda margin of 14% excluded its effects.
and please take into account, we book its $21 billion provision for bank debt the second quarter, around $21 million in the quarter cost impact the results here. quarterly generated $42 million or an increase of $1 compared to the second quarter '21 figures, due to inflation wage adjustments, but no increase in headcount. fairly expensive reach at $66 million or an increase of $60 million compared to the second quarter '21 figures due to a more active sales campaign and trade events. it's important to mention the [inaudible] basic does not include $21 million of bad debt provisions that we included in this graph here.
talk about investment in the second quarter '22, embraer invested a total of $42 million in product development and research, mainly product development. for example, two family freighter executive aviation [inaudible]. we invested also 30 million capex, mainly for service and support expansion business. we continue to invest to our future.
another with the news moving to free cash flow, and that's a results with regards to free cash flow. we continue highly focused and cash flow disciplined for positive trends. free cash flow in the second quarter '22 was a surplus of $91 million. represent a significant result supported by the divestment of embraer facility and optimization for working capital, driven by positive free cash flow year-to-date, even considering a production ramp up and delivered in the second semester.
moving to adjusted net results was a profit of $39 million due to the better performance and interest reduction of $28 million in the second quarter '22 year-on-year. the company finished the quarter with a total debt of $3.2 billion or $864 million leverage in line with our liability management strategy. embraer continues to deleverage their balance sheet. reducing systematically gross debt and improve the credit metrics.
moreover, reducing interest expenses. it's important to highlight that the net debt ebitda ratio is around four times in the second quarter of 2022. but in the next quarter, we will show a significant improvement because deliveries are concentrated in the second half. and we remain committed to improve our financial metrics.
with that, i finish my presentation and hand it back to francisco for his final remarks. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thanks, antonio. to close, i would like to make some comments on the supply chain issues. there is a major short term issue for the whole industry globally and we can't undermine this challenging environment. to minimize the impacts, we are working very close to our supply chain.
having people onsite at the main suppliers, developing all the logistical routes in working on improvements in internal processes in cycles to absorb part of the challenges. having said that, we are cautiously optimistic about year-end results and very confident about the mid-term future. a combination of innovation, enterprise, efficiency, and our fantastic people is very powerful and will make us grow sustainably. thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.

and that's why people are getting sicker with the supply chain. but for embraer, we saw this some months ago is not a surprise. but finalizing the question through the different graphs, there are going to be delivery right now in the month of august.

[operator instructions]. wait while we gather for questions. our next question comes from telephone. if you wish to activate your microphone, press star six, please.
unknown speaker
good morning, and thank you very much for taking my question. i'm curious, when we think about supply chain issues, do you see any scope for embraer to maybe undertake some small acquisitions if you need it to secure critical supply? i did ask the same question of your canadian competitor earlier this morning. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
ok. francisco speaking. at this moment -- hello. at this moment that we are working very close to our supply chain.
very close. we have a small army of people. i mean, the insides of the operations of our suppliers, of our service suppliers, of our sub suppliers. but we don't have any plans to acquire any supply as a strategy to resolve this problem.
we do believe we can resolve this with a closer collaboration with our suppliers partners.
unknown speaker
ok. great. and i apologize for all the background noise. just one very quick follow up, if i may.
can you remind me whether you have any supply at this juncture coming from the russian federation? and that's it for me. thank you.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
so i'm trying to speak to here. we only have one supplier from russia is titanium that we are partially already replacing by us and european suppliers. or some months ago we were at 85% buying demand in russia for titanium. now we are already below 60 and our plan is really to try to eliminate the source of the raw material.
part of it, we buy enough in russia.
unknown speaker
ok. let me leave it there. thank you very much for the time.
operator
[operator instructions]. since there are no further questions. this concludes today's question-and-answer session. that does concludes embraer's conference for today.

finally, our annual 2021 report was published in may. the report brings the main highlights of the year on innovation, financial performance, and a complete overview of embraer's esg actions in 2021. important to note that our report is already inside the framework friendly foreign investors in our company. the next slide, we would talk about growth and see more details of business unit highlights in the quarter.

thank you. 
antonio garcia -- chief financial officer
thanks, francisco, and good morning, everyone. let's talk about financial results. we deliver a stronger results in the second quarter. reinforcing our confidence in our financial performance for the year.
we continue highly focused in our pillars of deleverage the company, driving profitability and efficiency. embraer delivered 32 jets in the second quarter, of which 11 commercial aircraft and 21 executive jets, 12 large jets and nine mid-size jets, according to our schedule. we reaffirm all aspects of our 2022 financial and deliveries guidance with no material variation. deliveries is a good base and seasonally concentrated in the second half of the year.
we have noticed some concern from the sell side reports about deliveries for the year. but just as a reminder, we are today just four aircrafts in commercial aviation behind [inaudible]. despite the very challenging supply scenario, our plans have not changed, and we remain confident in the delivery of the aircrafts. [inaudible] order backlog ended second quarter 2022 at $17.8 billion, half billion more versus first quarter 2022.
this is the highest quarter backlog since beginning of the pandemic, 12% higher, driven by solid sales activities. revenues reached $1.90 billion in the quarter, down 10% compared to the second quarter of '21, due to lower deliveries in commercial and defense segments, partially offset by our service and support business unit. before starting with ebit and ebitda, i want to mention that we reported consolidated gross margin of 21.9% in the quarter was higher than the 18.2% reported in the second quarter of previous year '21. we find year-over-year profit in most segments due to the product and service mix pricing and overall operational performance, including tax efficiencies.
adjusted ebit and ebitda were $81 million and $125 million respectively using adjusted ebit margin of 8% and adjusted ebitda margin of 12.2%. it's important that you mention that our adjusted ebit in second quarter '22 also includes commercial aviation integration and arbitration expenses of around $60.5 million. if we exclude all these extraordinary effects, adjusted ebit margin would have to be our odds 10% or $100 million in the second quarter '22. and ebitda margin of 14% excluded its effects.
and please take into account, we book its $21 billion provision for bank debt the second quarter, around $21 million in the quarter cost impact the results here. quarterly generated $42 million or an increase of $1 compared to the second quarter '21 figures, due to inflation wage adjustments, but no increase in headcount. fairly expensive reach at $66 million or an increase of $60 million compared to the second quarter '21 figures due to a more active sales campaign and trade events. it's important to mention the [inaudible] basic does not include $21 million of bad debt provisions that we included in this graph here.
talk about investment in the second quarter '22, embraer invested a total of $42 million in product development and research, mainly product development. for example, two family freighter executive aviation [inaudible]. we invested also 30 million capex, mainly for service and support expansion business. we continue to invest to our future.
another with the news moving to free cash flow, and that's a results with regards to free cash flow. we continue highly focused and cash flow disciplined for positive trends. free cash flow in the second quarter '22 was a surplus of $91 million. represent a significant result supported by the divestment of embraer facility and optimization for working capital, driven by positive free cash flow year-to-date, even considering a production ramp up and delivered in the second semester.
moving to adjusted net results was a profit of $39 million due to the better performance and interest reduction of $28 million in the second quarter '22 year-on-year. the company finished the quarter with a total debt of $3.2 billion or $864 million leverage in line with our liability management strategy. embraer continues to deleverage their balance sheet. reducing systematically gross debt and improve the credit metrics.
moreover, reducing interest expenses. it's important to highlight that the net debt ebitda ratio is around four times in the second quarter of 2022. but in the next quarter, we will show a significant improvement because deliveries are concentrated in the second half. and we remain committed to improve our financial metrics.
with that, i finish my presentation and hand it back to francisco for his final remarks. thank you very much.
francisco gomes neto -- chief executive officer
thanks, antonio. to close, i would like to make some comments on the supply chain issues. there is a major short term issue for the whole industry globally and we can't undermine this challenging environment. to minimize the impacts, we are working very close to our supply chain.
having people onsite at the main suppliers, developing all the logistical routes in working on improvements in internal processes in cycles to absorb part of the challenges. having said that, we are cautiously optimistic about year-end results and very confident about the mid-term future. a combination of innovation, enterprise, efficiency, and our fantastic people is very powerful and will make us grow sustainably. thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.
