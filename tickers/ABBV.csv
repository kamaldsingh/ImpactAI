thank you. (operator instructions) our first question today is from steve scala from cowen.
stephen michael scala -- cowen and company, llc -- analyst
thank you. i have a few questions. first, raising guidance after the first quarter is clearly a sign of confidence in the outlook. i believe, abbvie raised after q1 last year on its way to a great full year performance. how many times in its history has abbvie raised guidance after the first quarter?
secondly, on the gross profit margin was quite strong. you mentioned the royalty relief. were there any other one-time benefits in the quarter?
and then, lastly, abbvie has an exciting late-stage pipeline, but also an expansive early to mid-stage pipeline. within the early to mid-stage pipeline, what products look most interesting and promising? thank you.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hi, steve. this is rick. i'll take the first question. i mean, obviously, we feel good about how the year started, and i said, we've started with a tremendous amount of momentum. certainly, as we look at the performance of the hematological oncology business and us humira, and many other products are performing extremely well. and so, that's certainly driving the level of confidence that we're seeing. as well as, we've now seen a substantial period of time that i think we can measure the impact of biosimilar competition outside the us and feel good about how that is tracking against our expectations.
specific to your question, we raised guidance three times in the first quarter and we've raised guidance, i think, 13 out of the 25 quarters that we've reported. and certainly we do not raise guidance in the first quarter unless you had a level of confidence that you could deliver that or greater performance across the year. that would just be a foolish position to take. so in both of the prior years where we raise in first quarter, those ended up being years where we outperformed significantly. so i think it is a good indication of the level of confidence that management has in the business whether it be our business or any other business, i think, it demonstrates a level of confidence, otherwise we wouldn't choose to do that.
and certainly, i am extremely pleased with how we've come out of the blocks in 2019 and i'm pleased with what -- how the pipeline has continued to deliver, and obviously, we'll be launching two major products this year skyrizi and ultimately we anticipate being able to launch upadacitinib this year in addition to the products we've already launched recently and are driving a tremendous amount of growth. so i have a lot of confidence in how the business can perform. with that, i will turn it over to rob to answer your second question.
robert a. michael -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hi, steve. it's rob. so we feel very good about our progress in gross margin. we just printed a new high. the lion's share of improvement you're seeing comes from the termination of humira royalties. we do have efficiencies in foreign exchange helping cover the impact of partnership accounting. but as you can see from our full year guidance, we have a lot -- we feel very good about the progress we've made in gross margin. so i wouldn't anticipate a lot of one-time impacts.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
mike, why don't you answer three?
michael e. severino -- m.d., vice chairman and president
sure. so, this is mike. we have obviously invested considerably in our late-stage pipeline. but we've also paid a large amount of attention and invested to make sure that we have broad and promising early to mid-stage pipeline as well. so i'd highlight programs from a couple of areas. although, it's a late-stage program, i think, it's one that doesn't get a lot of attention, and so, i think, it's worth mentioning, which is depatux-m, which used to be known as abt-414, which is our egfr targeted adc in egfr-amplified glioblastoma multiforme. that has delivered very interesting mid-stage data in the second-line patients with gbm and is in a randomized phase 3 study with overall survival as a primary endpoint now in front-line gbm. so, i think, that is potentially a very interesting opportunity, because there really is very limited treatment options available for these patients and so that's one that i think we can keep an eye on.
turning to our early pipeline. i would highlight in oncology. our work in apoptosis, which is really an extension of what we learned discovering and developing a venetoclax or bcl-2 inhibitor. we have a phase 2 study ongoing now with the different molecule with the venetoclax, which inhibits both bcl-2 and bcl-xl and that combination inhibition, that pattern of inhibition has potential in myelofibrosis and can specifically address the clone that drives that very serious hematologic disorder. there's really only one pathway currently that treat that disease. the current standard-of-care is jakafi.
in our phase 2 study we're looking at patients who failed or didn't respond to jakafi. we're looking at a pretty resistant population and even early on we're seeing some very interesting responses. and i think there's also real potential that we could address the underlying pathophysiology and therefore be disease-modifying in the bone marrow fibrosis. so that study is accruing by the end of this year, early next year, we will be in a position to make a decision to advance that program into later stage development.
we also have number of other programs that are just a little bit behind that one in apoptosis. programs like our trail program, which is an apoptosis related program that has promising solid tumors including things like colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer and we're seeing some very interesting responses in good pk-pd relationship in our early studies there. and we have a bc-xl targeted delivery for solid tumors also that add about the same stage of development.
if we shift to immuno-oncology, we've done a lot of work to advance our pipeline there. and one of the most novel programs in that area is program called garp, which is now abbv-151. that modulates tgf-beta and t-reg function which is thought to mediate the tumor immunosuppressive environment. so that's a program i think has a lot of solid science behind it is now in the clinic and we have a number of other novel io programs in the clinic as well.
if we now shift our focus to immunology, a couple of things i would point to our tnf steroid adc that has promised to deliver very high levels of response to patients, because we know that steroids are highly effective at managing the symptoms of ra and other immunological mediated diseases, but they can be given at high doses for long periods of time. so this program attempts to deliver a novel steroid directly to the immune effector cells in ra without systemic consequences or systemic adverse effects.
what we know from the early studies is we are able to dose this molecule in the range where we would expect to see efficacy without seeing those widespread steroid like effects and we're now moving into a randomized study that will give proof-of-concept and should read out next year. we've invested in other programs in immunology as well, like our cd40 antagonist and our jack btk combination program. so a lot of data to come there.
last area i focus on is neuroscience. people are familiar with our tal antibody, which is in phase 2, but we've built a broad pipeline behind that and our two neuroinflammation assets that we're developing in partnership with alector are now in the clinic and so those are some very interesting programs. so there's a lot of data to come over the next 12 months to 18 months.
stephen michael scala -- cowen and company, llc -- analyst
thank you.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from chris schott from jp morgan.
christopher thomas schott -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
great. thanks very much for the questions. my first one was on skyrizi and just how we're thinking about that launch ramp. i guess, historically, we've seen some of the newer psoriasis agents having relatively gradual ramps and then maybe a few years to really gain momentum. i guess, is that fair to think about in this situation or when we think about the higher payer access you cited in the commercial infrastructure you have, should we think about all the different dynamic here?
and your second question, just kind of building on that is, how are you thinking about humira dynamics in dermatology with this launch and with a range of new agents coming in. i know that business remained fairly healthy, but should we think about the growth slowing at that indication over time?
and maybe the final one was just on business development priorities, just latest thoughts on how you're thinking about business development, and i guess, specifically, how you're prioritizing revenue growth potential versus diversification as you think about potential deals that you'd be looking at? thanks so much.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hi, chris. this is rick. i think if you look at skyrizi and you look at the ramp and you compare to historical ramps, one of the limiting factors in the historical has been their ability to be able to get market access -- broad based market access in a reasonable period of time and that's always a limiter, no matter what product we're talking about, what specialty product we're talking about, if you don't have access, it makes the launch extremely difficult, but what most companies do is subsidize with free goods for a period of time until they can get access. but no one has gotten access like we're describing here. so, certainly, access should enhance the ramp of skyrizi.
now having said that, it takes a few months even in our case, to get to the level of access that we're talking about. so in the current quarter, you shouldn't expect much in the way of skyrizi revenue, because we are going to use free goods extensively during that period of time, but that access should ramp dramatically as we get toward the end of the quarter and moving into the next quarter. and then you should expect that the product will ramp. as with any new mechanism, it obviously take some time to get physicians familiar with it, but i would expect skyrizi to ramp more significantly than what you've seen with historical ramp. so i think that would be a reasonable way to be thinking about it.
as it relates to humira dynamics. i think if you have to look at the profile of skyrizi and think about where it would fit in the treatment paradigm for patients. here you have an agent that has pasi 90, pasi 100 scores, like we've never seen before and it's an agent that has a good benefit risk profile. so from a safety standpoint, i think, there will be a high level of comfort around it and it's an agent that obviously has significant advantages from a dosing standpoint, where patients will only have to inject themselves once a quarter.
so when you look at all of those dynamics, you have to ask yourself the question, why wouldn't that be a front-line agent and indeed that will be certainly how we will be positioning this agent, it has the profile to be able to deliver against that criteria that would be appropriate for front-line naive patients, and obviously, an agent that will also be used extensively for those patients that are switching from a therapy that ultimately -- they're not getting the level of efficacy that they desire and need.
now, humira, obviously, will maintain, there's a large number of well maintained patients on humira. obviously you don't switch a patient that is well maintained. it is not just appropriate. and so -- but i would expect that you will start to see humira slow somewhat in the psoriasis category as skyrizi starts to ramp in a very significant way.
the last question is around business development. and what i would say there is, if you look at our business, obviously, our business continues to perform well. we launched a significant number of products over the course of the last several years, you're starting to see that diversification. in fact, last year, if you look at the -- what drove our growth, it was very balanced growth between imbruvica, humira, mavyret and to a lesser extent venclexta. so you're starting to see that diversity or that diversification play out and obviously we're launching significant number of additional assets, we launched some at the end of the year and then more will launch this year with skyrizi and upadacitinib. that will drive over time more diversification.
having said that, we have a business that generates significant cash flow and our first priority is always using that cash flow to be able to invest back in the business. and so we look at all different kinds of transactions, small ones, medium-sized ones and larger ones. we look at them all in the backdrop of do they strategically fit in the enhanced long-term performance of the business and are they value at a point which we can get a good return for the investment that we need to make. and when we find those, we obviously act on those and we have the financial wherewithal to do that. so that's how we think about it, and i wouldn't say that's different than how we've historically thought about it, but that is how we look at business development.
christopher thomas schott -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
thank you.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from jason gerberry from bank of america.
jason matthew gerberry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i guess just first one on the eu humira guidance. i think the 2q guidance was for $1 billion, which is about 40% down. so i was just wondering if you could help square that for us in terms of the 30% erosion for the full year. and then also help us reconcile, i think, biogen yesterday mentioned that there's about 35% biosimilar share in europe. so just trying to put these data points together, it would seem like, perhaps, the erosion profile might be a little bit worse in europe than you would -- than the last guidance. so if you can provide a little clarity there that would be helpful?
and then, i guess, just second question, just on the orilissa launch, can you just give us a little color how this is progressing, it is progressing according to plan, are there some early challenges that there maybe a little greater than initially anticipated, that would be helpful as well? thanks.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
okay. jason, this is rick. i'll answer those questions for you. first, to the point that you made about the erosion, the erosion that we quoted on the call was 30% against the total international base. i think we said at the time, if you just looked within the segment that we are growing in biosimilar that was around 40% or 44%, something in that range. so it is consistent with that. the guidance is consistent with what we originally talked about, and i'd say that's the guidance that we are absolutely comfortable with as things are playing out.
if you look specifically to the biogen comment. i think for biogen said, although, i didn't read the transcript, but others did, is i think what they said was that share was in germany. and i'd say, it's in the range of that in germany. i can't remember the specific number that they quoted, remember, germany has a quota system that they use and that quota is that 40% of the prescriptions written by their doctors, their physicians should be biosimilar products and so they are obviously going to drive to that 40% and they're not -- they're approaching that now. so i don't think that is a big surprise.
if you look more broadly across all of europe -- all of the areas that are affected by biosimilars in europe, then the share would be about 16% right now in the first quarter. we would expect that that will rise over the course of the year, which is just how we planned it. we plan two things, rising share and more price erosion as we advance toward the fourth quarter and that is how our forecast is built. so it's tracking against that forecast well. i think if you look at biogen and amgen, i'd say they have been the most aggressive in the market thus far. so biogen quoted what they were getting up that share in germany, i have no reason to believe that that wasn't accurate and but that's essentially how the biosimilars are going. so i'd say, i think, now actually we had more experience, we're pretty comfortable with how the biosimilars are sorting themselves out.
on orilissa, the ramp is going or the launch is going as we would expect. we have spent quite a bit of time out educating physicians. this is a physician population that hasn't had a new medicine in this area in order they prescribe a lot of these types of medicines in their practice generally. i'd say the receptivity that we're seeing physician -- from physicians is very good, very positive. these feedback we're getting from patients as they start i think is encourage. it would be suggestive of the fact that even into 150-milligram dose patients are seeing rapid relief of pain. so i think that's certainly positive and they like the profile of the drug.
we started the dtc campaign a couple of months ago and that will be an important aspect of this launch. and we said all along, this is a -- this is an area where we're ultimately going to have to build the market. and it's important to remember, these patients are typically younger women, right, and they don't go to their doctor every couple of months. they go to their doctor typically once a year. so engaging them and making them understand that there is a therapy available, and therefore, they should go to their doctor off cycle is an important part of this launch and building this launch.
i would say it's tracking well, compared to what we would have expected. the drug has right now about a $60 million running rate and growing. so it's within the expectations that we had. and long-term, i can tell you, our expectations are still. this will be a very sizable product for us going forward, albeit, it's going to be more of a slower ramp than some other products like hcv where they ramp very rapidly.
jason matthew gerberry -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, jason. operator, we'll take the next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from navin jacob from ubs.
navin jacob -- ubs -- analyst
hi. yes. thanks for taking my questions. maybe a question for bill and a question for rick, if i may. bill, with the nice increase to your operating margin guidance to 47% for 2019. how confident are you in your 2020 operating margin guidance of 50%, i mean, that -- what's driving that 300 bps of increase?
and then second question for rick. obviously, the pharma group over the last two weels, three weeks has been under significant pressure, last week lease was associated with medicare for all concerns, before that ipi and rebate rule. there's a lot of things proposed a lot of things discussed. i guess, rick, help us understand beyond, obviously, i'm not going to ask you to handicap political outcomes, but beyond the political hurdles, what are some of the practical hurdles associated with broader form such as medicare for all? and then with regards to the rebate rule, what are your expectations going into next year, assuming implication -- implementation? how that will affect abbvie's ability to deal with marketplace, which is fundamentally has been driven with the inflammation marketplace, which has fundamentally been driven by -- a lot by how payors position products? thanks.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
okay. thank you. rob, why don't you answer the first?
robert a. michael -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
hi, navin. this is rob. so we're in the process of developing our lrp right now. so i'm not going to give you 2020 guidance. but let me tell you how to think about it. if you think about the 2019 profile, we're up about 250 basis points, despite the investment for new product launches and flattish sales. in 2020, you should see increased p&l leverage as those new products ramp and the overall top-line grows. so that's the way i would model it.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. as it relates to the debate that's ongoing about affordability of healthcare and affordability of medicines. it certainly is obvious to everyone that there is a very significant debate that is ongoing here. i think fundamentally comes back to having patients have access to the medicines that they need and making sure that those medicines are priced in a range where they are affordable and they are justified based on the pharmacoeconomics of those particular agents. we should hope it will get to that debate. i think eventually it will get to that debate.
and so as you look at patients ability to be able to access medicines. i think it's important to think about it in the backdrop of where is the challenge in that. i would tell you as an example, and i don't think we're unusual, but we have a very extensive patient assistance program and that program actually allows patients up to 600% of poverty, which i think is around $150,000 a year worth of income for a family of four somewhere thereabouts, that in the event they can't afford their medicines, they can come to us and we obviously will provide the medicine even free of charge and we provide a significant amount of medicine to those patients.
those programs are available to commercially insured patients, to uninsured patients, and therefore, there shouldn't be a patient that falls into that category. it doesn't have access to an abbvie medicine regardless of their ability to be able to pay. now do people fall through the net and they don't realize it. we are looking into that and we may actually do some additional awareness campaigns to make sure patients understand how to be able to access that that program. but i can tell you we have pretty broad coverage of that program, and we monitor how many patients don't qualify because of their income levels and we always constantly look at whether or not we have that set appropriately for patients who can't afford the medicine.
and so we adjust it in time based on the percent of over poverty income to ensure that we're trying to cover the vast majority of those patients. so, you shouldn't have a significant problem with those kinds of patients. then you look at commercially insured patients, obviously, the industry provides a significant level of co-pay assistance to those patients and so that shouldn't be a challenge.
where the challenge does exist, because these programs are not available broadly to patients on medicare part d, is in medicare part d. the non-lis portion of medicare part d has very high out-of-pocket costs for medicines, particularly specialty medicines and to sort of put in perspective for you, a medicare part d patient, if you compare their out-of-pocket expense to a commercially insured patient, a patient on medicaid, a patient who isn't part d, but part of the lis program, their out-of-pocket expense for something like humira is a little over 50 times, five-zero times, what it is compared to those other patient populations, which is a pretty significant burden on those patients.
and so i think, one of the things, we're trying to drive as we go through this process is, i think, it is the industry's responsibility to help step up and try to cover some of that cost and share some of that with the government to be able to make it affordable for those patients, that is just too high a burden on medicare patients to be able to afford that. and i think that's the area that you have the greatest challenge from an ability to access these kinds of medicines. and so, we are obviously trying to come up with ways that we can suggest or try to participate in the process to help alleviate that challenge and i think we should be willing to come to the table and help drive that.
now, people say, well, what about the cost associated with that? if you look at the part d plan and you look at the overall cost, compared to how enrollment has increased over time, i would tell you that the part d plan has worked extremely well from a competitiveness standpoint, the insurers that negotiate this and the pbms that negotiated on behalf of the government, drive a pretty hard bargain and you see fairly significant rebating or discounting in this program.
i think one of the challenges and i will get to that here in a minute when we talk about rebate. one of the challenges is it would appear most of that rebate is being put back into the premiums, lowering the premiums and so there is this debate, where should that rebate money go back, should it go back against the actual drug costs or should be built back into the premiums and look that's not a decision that we make and i think that is part of where the rebate challenge comes in.
now, as it relates to patients, well, certainly, i think, most of us believe that patient shouldn't be paying against the list price of their substantial rebates. and so the rebate rule as it's proposed right now, would allow manufacturers like us to discount at the point-of-sale or point of pharmacy to be able to reflect that and then that would be reflected in what the patient pays. i can tell you we are totally supportive of the patient paying off of the rebated price or the discounted price. i think that is absolutely appropriate.
whether the rebate rule goes through as it is or some modification or doesn't go through at all, look, i can't handicap that. we have analyzed how it would as is currently proposed and as we've said many times, it doesn't affect our business, one way or another, whether it's a rebate or a discount, they are one and the same. and so, i think, we're comfortable with -- if that were to go through, being able to manage our business in a very similar way to the way we manage our business now. i think one of the challenges with medicare for all would be you'd have to look pretty carefully at this drug benefit, because you would have patients who if they switched off one of those other programs and went on medicare, at least the way medicare part d works right now. their co-pay out-of-pocket is going to go up dramatically. and i think that's not something that they would necessarily like. so i think that's a significant challenge.
but i think one way or another we have to attack that and resolve this. this group making sure that they have good access, affordable access to drugs that they need. now these are drugs that don't get abused. now at the end of the day, take a drug like humira. humira is step edited has prior authorization. the patient has to fail all the lower cost alternatives before they ever get access to a medicine like humira. so there is not any real risk of abuse in this kind of a category. and so i think that's something else that's important to put in perspective as we have this debate.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, navin. operator, we'll take the next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from josh schimmer from evercore isi.
joshua elliott schimmer -- evercore isi institutional equities -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. just want to clarify some of the points on guidance. on the fourth quarter call, you had indicated orilissa would be around $200 million this year. is it on track for that or might that take a little longer to achieve? and then just follow-up on your answer to jason's question about the ous guidance for humira this year, sorry, in the second quarter being down 40% year-over-year. you talked about the expected cadence of erosion in europe. but ous is still projected to be down 40%. so you can elaborate on the answer and reconciling that with the initial guidance of 30% for global us for the -- ex us for the year? thank you.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so on orilissa -- josh, this is rick. on orilissa i would say that we are tracking against that number. so we're not changing our guidance on that number. and obviously, as i said, it has a running rate right now of about $60 million. and so it's ramping significantly from that. and i'd say, based on everything we know today, we're comfortable with that ramp. i'm not 100% sure i understand the question that you asked on the second one. rob, i mean, you said something about 40% in the second quarter?
robert a. michael -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
so, josh, this is rob. if you look at the guidance and compare that to our total international sales in the prior year that would put you at a 33% operational decline. so i'm not sure how you're getting your 40%.
william j. chase -- executive vice president, finance and administration
and that -- josh, this is bill. that would be in the second quarter, as you look at the gating of the impact around biosimilars recognized in q4, we are going to be comparing against a quarter in the prior year that already had some biosimilars. so you would expect actually that year-over-year impact to be less than what we're seeing in the first three quarters. so it averages out to our overall guidance.
joshua elliott schimmer -- evercore isi institutional equities -- analyst
okay. thanks.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks josh. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoff meacham from barclays.
geoffrey christopher meacham -- barclays bank plc -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks so much for the question. just had a few. mike on venclexta and myeloma the imbalance i'm sure was a surprise, what's the hypothesis at this point. i'm not sure it's clear, what's different about myeloma versus clr or aml in terms of unique safety tolerability risk and how does this alter your long-term view of the value of the drug?
and then, rick, had another one on capital allocation. you guys have obviously expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory and without a large transaction. so my question is whether there are triggers that would evolve that strategy, for example, like if the -- if ous humira is worse than expected later this year or next or your launches don't have initial objectives, what do you do from there and how much of a priority is the payout in that scenario? thank you very much.
michael e. severino -- m.d., vice chairman and president
okay. so, this is mike. i'll take the first one. so with respect to bellini and the imbalance that we observed in mortality in the overall population. yes, obviously, that was a surprise to us. that's not something that we would have expected to see. i think it's hard to say with certainty what drove that. but i think comparing and contrasting the situation to cll is important.
so what we know about cll is that cll is bcl-2 driven and you see that in the efficacy results that we've driven across our cll program from the very early studies in 17p del from the murano study and all the work that we've done. if you look at multiple myeloma, there are, from our perspective, really, really two groups. now i'm speaking from a bcl-2 biology perspective. there is a subset, which is this t(11;14) subset. so it's a subset, but it's about 20% of multiple myeloma and add it to obviously a significant proportion given that -- we have seen it improved given that myeloma overall is very big. and that subset is very highly bcl-2 driven in it's biology.
then there is the broader population where the hypothesis was a little different. there the hypothesis was primarily synergy with proteasome inhibitors that we've seen mechanistically and that we saw in earlier studies. and so the bellini result is that overall non-selected group. and so while we can't tell you with certainty today what drove that, what we can tell you is that that behavior is very different than what we've seen in other populations. in the t(11;14) group, it's very bcl-2 driven. the early data that we've seen suggests that we should see a good effect and that's why we continue to expect that the drug has a role in that population.
now, obviously, we're going to need to take the time to work with the fda around the issues of the partial clinical hold, but we do believe that in the long-term there will be a role or at least potential for a role in that population. so that's really the difference between multiple myeloma and cll. so does this change our long-term view of the value of the asset? no it doesn't change our long-term view of the value of the asset. it doesn't change our view of cll in anyway. and we had always felt that the larger opportunity because the clearer link to the biology for venclexta in myeloma was in that biomarker driven population.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
geoff, this is rick. so on your question, i think, the best way to think about it is this. if you look at 2019 and i think it is a good test. our ability and our strategies ability to be able to withstand significant loe. if you think about 2019 roughly just under $5 billion of humira that's facing loe and probably something in the neighborhood of about $500 million of androgel that's facing loe. and you are in the very early stages of the launch of several of our new products like orilissa, like skyrisi and ultimately it will be like upadacitinib. so you're not getting much benefit. in fact if anything you're getting a little downdraft because everyone knows in the first year or so, the pharmaceutical launch of lose money because you have to apply a significant amount of sg&a to it to create the ramp. so you actually have headwinds from a profit performance standpoint.
so -- and you can see based on that, we have a business now that still has positive revenue growth and has eps growth of 11%, let's call it. and yes, there's some share repurchases in there. but if you adjust that share repurchase out, it's still high single-digit eps growth. so tremendous eps growth despite those headwinds that we're facing. and i think that demonstrates the strength of the underlying business and it was really designed to be able to deal with that.
now having said that, i don't know that those kinds of dynamics are what's going to drive, how we look at opportunities that exist from an acquisition standpoint. what drives that is what i described before. it is always better to have a stronger business than we can't have too strong of the business. so resets the philosophy that we operate with. and so as we look at different kinds of transactions we evaluate them against their strategic fit. and then, can we get a good return on those assets and if our analysis suggests that we can, then we obviously try to act on those and that's what drives from a capital allocation standpoint where we invest. and i don't see a dramatic change in the way international biosimilars behave, because obviously, i think, we've seen enough of that now that we have a pretty good idea of how they are behaving. and that would drive -- that would be a trigger event in and of itself. i think what will drive -- what we do is ultimately can we build a stronger business, if we were to acquire an asset, whatever that asset maybe.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, geoff. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
thank you. our final question today is from vamil divan from credit suisse.
vamil kishore divan -- credit suisse ag -- analyst
hi. great. thanks for taking my questions. so just two on the product side. first for upadacitinib, i think we're about four months from the pdufa date. just wondering, i don't know if you -- i apologize, if you mentioned on your prepared remarks. i am wondering, if you have any updated thoughts on the likelihood of the adcom ahead of decision. and just the impact with other recent safety update on xeljanz regarding the -- you raised some more questions about thrombosis risk with jak inhibition and wondering what you -- how you think that might impact the review?
and then second one on skyrizi, you mentioned the dosing advantage you guys have with tremfya, just looking at the label, there is a little bit higher rate of immunogenicity with the product that with tremfya. i think it's about 14% of patients had antibodies that can be classified as neutralizing. so just wondering how you think physicians might think of the trade-off between more convenient dosing, but maybe a little bit more immunogenicity for a chronic condition like psoriasis? thanks.
michael e. severino -- m.d., vice chairman and president
sure. so, this is mike. i'll take those. with respect to upadacitinib, we are still in the relatively early stages of our review, but we are several months into it. with respect to the likelihood of an adcom. what i've said before, is that advisory committees are common for these sorts of applications. so for novel molecular entities and rhemathoid arthritis. so it wouldn't be necessarily surprising, if we had one or concern to us if we had one. but based on what we're hearing today, we do not anticipate one. and so, obviously, as we get closer, we'll be able to provide additional color on that.
with respect to xeljanz and the safety finding that came out of their large-scale study. i'd say a couple of things. one, we need to see the data presented in full. we need to see how that translates through their label, but i would point a couple of features. one, that was at a dose that was higher than approved in ra for xeljanz and it was in a very particular patient population, because it was in their cardiovascular safety study.
so these were patients who were selected to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. so they were a little different than the broader patient population. our program hasn't demonstrated an increased risk for vtes for upadacitinib compared to essentially all of the competitors that we had in the trial, which include humira, includes methotrexate and in our monotherapy studies, for a portion of time, it even includes true placebo. so we feel very good about our data set.
with respect to skyrizi. what i would point to is the performance of the product. we have very, very strong performance. we are clearly covering the pathway very effectively and doing that with the favorable benefit risk profile. we have skin clearance that's actually rising over time and very durable out to a year. and so i don't see that as a concern at all for us.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. all participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. (operator instructions)
i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and thanks for joining us. also, on the call with me, today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; bill chase, executive vice president of finance and administration; and rob michael, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
before we get started, i would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
additional information about the factors that may affect abbvie's operations is included in our 2018 annual report on form 10-k and in our other sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law.
on today's conference call as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's ongoing business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
so, with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick.
richard a. gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our first quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising this quarter. mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our r&d programs and rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. following our remarks, we will take your questions.
i'm pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start in 2019, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of our business. we are seeing strong momentum across all aspects of our operations, with excellent growth from our hematological oncology portfolio, continued robust growth from humira in the us, international biosimilar impacts is trending within our expectations for 2019. and importantly, our late-stage pipeline continues to deliver, with the recent approval of skyrizi in major markets globally.
we delivered first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, representing growth of more than 14% versus the prior year, and once again exceeding our guidance. total revenues of more than $7.8 billion were also ahead of expectations for the quarter, with several key products contributing to that growth. we saw excellent performance from our hematological oncology business, with global operational sales growth of more than 43%.
us humira grew more than 7% versus a last year, driven by continued robust demand. international humira sales were down 23% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in europe and other international markets. the international biosimilar trends and dynamics have been consistent with our expectations.
we also saw a substantial contributions from several other products in our portfolio, including mavyret, creon and duodopa. we're certainly pleased with our commercial performance and our financial results for the quarter, and we remain well-positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in 2019. as noted in our earnings release, we are raising our full year 2019 guidance and now expect adjusted earnings between $8.73 and $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint.
in addition to the strong financial results, we have continued to make significant progress, building a pipeline that will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. since our inception, we've put tremendous effort and resources toward developing new therapies that advance the standard-of-care across a spectrum of important disease states. with special emphasis on doing so in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases, our central focus has been on advancing new medicines that will raise the bar and address important therapeutic needs for patients.
we believe that risankizumab and upadacitinib have achieved the objectives that we set forth. both of these therapies have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus humira, as well as other mechanisms on the market or those in development. this profile coupled with our strong commercial execution gives us tremendous confidence that both will be the new standard-of-care in their respective indications.
we recently announced the approval of risankizumab now known as skyrizi in the us and japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. these approvals mark a major milestone for abbvie and further demonstrate our commitment and leadership in immunology. we're certainly pleased with the approved label for skyrizi, which reflects its best in category efficacy, favorable benefit risk and quarterly dosing.
as you know, we also have a highly experienced team, including the leading immunology marketing team and sales force, which will support this launch. given its compelling product profile, we expect to secure rapid and broad formulary coverage for skyrizi, with more than 50% commercial access by the end of july, a 90-day access metric not achieved by any other recent launch in the psoriasis category. skyrizi represents a significant long-term opportunity for abbvie, with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential.
we have also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of upadacitinib, our jak1-selective inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis. we've been extremely encouraged by the level of efficacy and benefit risk profile observed across the entire upadacitinib clinical program, including its clear superiority versus humira, the current gold standard for the treatment of ra. based on the data generated across our program, we believe upadacitinib will offer meaningful advantage over other products on the market today for those in development and we remain on track for us regulatory decision in the third quarter.
with a robust and differentiated data we produced from our assets and the launch of several new products now under way, we remain confident that the strategy we have in place is working extremely well. we're excited to see the evolution of our pipeline assets from promising late-stage development compounds to successful on-market products. skyrizi marks the 12th new product or major indication approval for abbvie in the last five years, demonstrating the productivity of our r&d investments, which is vital for the long-term success of any innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company like ours.
so, in summary, i'm extremely pleased with the strong execution and pipeline advancement we're seeing, leading to our increase in expectations for 2019. we are off to an exceptional start of the year, followed by several years of market-leading performance and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver top tier financial performance in 2019 and beyond.
with that, i will turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d programs. mike?
michael e. severino -- m.d., vice chairman and president
thank you, rick. i'll start with immunology, where, as rick noted, we've made significant progress with both of our late-stage assets. we recently received approval in the us and japan for skyrizi in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and expect an approval decision in europe very soon. based on the positive chmp opinion we received at the end of february. these approvals are supported by a broad clinical development program, where skyrizi demonstrated a very start strong profile in phase 3 studies across more than 2,000 patients.
we are pleased with the skyrizi label, which reflects the efficacy and safety profile demonstrated across our program. as we evaluate the available biologic treatment options, we believe skyrizi has a best in disease product profile, with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients the most important, including skin clearance, durability of response and dosing, with a favorable benefit risk profile.
in our phase 3 studies, skyrizi demonstrated very high rates of durable skin clearance, with more than 80% of patients achieving pasi 90 and 60% of patients achieving pasi 100 or complete skin clearance at one year. importantly, the proportion of skyrizi treated patients who achieve these high levels of response increased over time. in fact, the level of complete skin clearance at the one-year mark is the highest reported in a phase 3 program to our knowledge.
in psoriasis both speed and durability of response are important considerations for an optimal therapy, as loss of efficacy is a key concern for both patients and physicians. our clinical trials demonstrated clearance after just a single dose of skyrizi, as measured by the mean change in pasi score. the average skin clearance following the first dose was 58%, increasing to 91% after two doses and 95% after five doses.
skyrizi also provides a best in category dosing profile, with convenient quarterly dosing and flexibility for in-office or at home self-administration. we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to psoriasis patients. we also continue to make good progress with the development programs for skyrizi in several other immune-mediated conditions, with late-stage studies ongoing in several follow-on indications. we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.
moving now to our other late-stage immunology assets, upadacitinib, where regulatory applications are currently under review for its initial indication rheumatoid arthritis. our regulatory submissions are based on a comprehensive phase 3 program. in our program, upadacitinib demonstrated strong results across a wide range of patients, including patients early in the treatment paradigm, who are naive to methotrexate, as well as patients who are heavily pre-treated with biologics. upadacitinib is the only jak1-selective inhibitor to meet all primary and secondary endpoints across all registrational trials.
importantly, upadacitinib demonstrated clear superiority versus humira across all key measures evaluated in a head-to-head study, as well as clear structural benefit in two phase 3 studies. upadacitinib also performed extremely well as monotherapy, which we view as another important differentiator, because although methotrexate is commonly used as a first-line therapy, many patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate methotrexate treatment. based on the data generated across our clinical program, we remain confident in the benefit risk profile for upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over other therapeutic options. we continue to anticipate a regulatory decision in the third quarter and look forward to bringing this new therapy to the market.
moving now to our hematologic oncology portfolio. in the quarter imbruvica received fda approval for its 10th indication. for using combination with gazyva in front-line cll. this represents the first approval for a chemotherapy free combination regimen and treatment-naive patients with cll. the approval is based on results from the phase 3 illuminate study, in which treatment with the combination of imbruvica and gazyva demonstrated a significant improvement in the risk of progression or death compared to treatment with chlorambucil and gazyva. illuminate trial is one of several important phase 3 studies that have demonstrated treatment with imbruvica alone or in combination significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared to therapies such as fcr, br and gc and previously untreated cll patients.
these studies add to the breadth of data supporting imbruvica, providing physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. the data from three of these studies have been reflected in the nccn treatment guidelines for front-line cll, which now position imbruvica as the only preferred regimen in the major segments of this market. we anticipate submitting data from other phase 3 studies in front-line cll for label augmentation later this year or early next year.
moving now to venclexta, where our supplemental nda and front-line cll is currently being reviewed by the fda under its real-time oncology review program. in conjunction with this submission venclexta received priority review, as well as a fifth breakthrough therapy designation. if granted, this approval will provide physicians and patients an important new treatment option and substantially expand the addressable population for which is venclexta is approved in cll. we anticipate a regulatory decision later this year.
last month, we disclosed top line data from the phase 3 bellini study in patients with relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. while the study met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the venclexta arm compared to the control arm. based on these data the fda placed a partial clinical hold on all trials evaluating venclexta in multiple myeloma. we're working with the fda to further analyze these results. but based on the data we have produced today, we continue to believe there is a potential role for venclexta in the t(11;14) biomarket defined myeloma population. we will provide updates on the multiple myeloma program as they become available.
moving now to the area of women's health, where we're nearing completion of our pivotal program for elagolix in uterine fibroids. our registrational program evaluated nearly 800 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in two pivotal studies. the results of the two pivotal studies demonstrated that elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo. current non-surgical treatments are limited in this area and women suffering from uterine fibroids need more therapeutic options. the results from these studies represent a significant advancement for women suffering from uterine fibroids and approval in this disease would represent an attractive follow on indication. we remain on track to submit our regulatory application in the middle of this year.
and in neuroscience, we are in the process of initiating a phase 3 trial to support registration of abbv 951, our innovative, subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system. continuous delivery of levodopa/carbidopa has proven to be very effective in managing motor fluctuations in patients with advanced parkinson's disease. duopa has helped to establish abbvie's presence in this market and by providing patients with a less invasive non-surgical delivery option, this next-generation approach has the potential to broaden the treated patient population and help strengthen abbvie's position in the advanced pd market.
in summary, we're extremely pleased with the productivity of our r&d organization, as we continue to invest in our pipeline to develop innovative medicines and support our long-term growth. we're seeing progress across all stages and in all therapeutic areas of our pipeline. with many important catal -- catalysts expected over the next 12 months to 18 months.
with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. rob?
robert a. michael -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike. as rick mentioned, we had another quarter of outstanding performance. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up more than 14% compared to prior year and $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. for the first quarter, net revenues were up 0.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1% -- 1.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. strong growth from several key products offset the impact of the first full quarter of international biosimilar competition.
us humira sales were $3.2 billion, up 7.1% compared to prior year, driven by continued strong demand. wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month in the quarter. international humira sales were $1.2 billion, down 23% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across europe and other international markets, and in line with our expectations.
hematologic oncology global sales were $1.2 billion, up 43.2% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both imbruvica and venclexta. imbruvica global net revenues were more than $1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the front-line cll segment. in cll, imbruvica remains the market leader across all lines of therapy, with new patient share of more than 25% in the front-line setting. venclexta revenues were $151 million, driven by continued progress in the broad relapsed refractory cll segment and our recent launch in first-line aml.
we continue to be pleased with our strong global position in hcv. in the us, hcv revenues were up more than 17%, reflecting higher market share versus the prior year quarter. our international business has also experienced positive share dynamics. but given patient de-warehousing in select markets during the prior year quarter, international hcv revenue declined approximately 25% on an operational basis, consistent with our expectations. we also saw continued strong operational sales growth for both duodopa and creon.
turning now to the p&l profile for the first quarter. adjusted gross margin was 83.3% of sales, up 310 basis points compared to the prior year, including a 280-basis-point benefit related to the expiration of humira royalties. adjusted r&d investment was 15.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas. adjusted sg&a was 20% of sales, consistent with our expectations. the adjusted operating margin was 48.1% of sales, an improvement of 400 basis points versus the prior year. net interest expense was $325 million and the adjusted tax rate was 7.9%.
as mentioned earlier, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.73 to $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. excluded from this guidance is $1.47 of known intangible amortization and specified items, as well as a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the recent approval of skyrizi. we plan to communicate details about this charge on our second quarter earnings call. this revised guidance continues to contemplate full year revenue growth of approximately 1% on an operational basis. at current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth.
as rick and mike noted, we're pleased with the recent approval of skyrizi. given the quarterly dosing schedule and our free goods program to bridge patients to commercial access, we expect very modest sales contribution from skyrizi in the second quarter. for the full year, our revenue guidance includes approximately $150 million of skyrizi sales, which will predominantly occur in the second half of the year. all other full year 2019 forecast assumptions for our key products remain unchanged.
turning now to the p&l for 2019. we now expect an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83% and we now expect adjusted operating margin to be just above 47%, roughly 250 basis points above prior year and inclusive of the required investments for our new product launches. all other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged.
as we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.22, excluding approximately $0.30 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. as mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the approval of skyrizi. we anticipate second quarter adjusted revenue above $8.1 billion. at current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1.5%. for us humira, we expect sales growth of approximately 7%. we expect international humira sales of approximately $1 billion assuming current exchange rates. and for imbruvica we expect global sales approaching $1.1 billion .
moving now to the p&l for the second quarter. we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio comparable to first quarter results. we anticipate higher spending in the second half of the year related to new product launches. and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with our full year guidance, which is just above our 2018 rate.
in summary, abbvie has once again delivered an excellent quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. our strong growth prospects have enabled us to position the business for another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite biosimilar dynamics and the required investments to support several major product launches. we are very pleased with abbvie's strong performance.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
elizabeth shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. operator, first question please.
",2019-Q1,ABBV
1.0,1.0,0.9996,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and our first question today is from geoffrey porges from svb leerink.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you very much, and as usual, i appreciate all the detail in the guidance. and congratulations on the results. a quick question on skyrizi and one on rinvoq. first, one of your competitors had a negative result of a post-marketing study recently.
i'm just wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators about conducting any other studies for rinvoq or updating the label for rinvoq as a result of that negative signal? and then secondly, on skyrizi, a commercial question. your current price for the 150-milligram dose is about $85,000, and you're using 4x the dose for ulcerative colitis. could you just tell us how you can manage that? and is it feasible to have sort of different prices despite that big difference in dosing? thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
ok. this is mike. i will take your second question first, and then we can cover the skyrizi question. with respect to rinvoq, i assume you're talking about the tofacitinib safety study, which top-line results fairly recently in the last several days and showed in that program that they were unable to exclude a risk of mace or malignancy based on the criteria that were used to analyze that data set.
as i said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data, both at the time of the nda and in an ongoing manner since that time, and we've not seen a signal. our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates, and the rates overall remain low. with respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators. regulators have not asked us do a long-term safety study in the way that pfizer was asked, so that has not been discussed with regulators.
and we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
right.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
and with respect to skyrizi?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. hi. it's jeff stewart on the commercial question. we have anticipated the different markets and how we will approach the pricing.
now, it's important that we're just starting to see the skyrizi data. we saw the induction data. we'll see the maintenance data. i think it's important that as we look at our strategy that we're honing is for skyrizi, you're going to -- for crohn's, you're going to have an induction dose, which is an iv at a different dose, and we know that based on the form and some things we can believe we can price that to market.
and also, we're coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well, depending on where that dosing falls out. and we would be using at that point, which is known an on-body injector. so the combination of the forms, as well as basically the ways that we will deliver the medication when we get there, we believe that we can price effectively to the market and manage it across the indications.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. i think the bottom line is we've contemplated that. it's a good question, geoff. but i think we have a strategy that will allow us to deal with that and impact the market in an appropriate way.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, geoff. operator, next question, please.
operator
and our next question is from vamil divan from mizuho securities.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hi. great. thanks so much for taking the questions. maybe two if i could.
so one, i appreciate the long-term guidance you've given recently on the top line. i'm just wondering how we should may be thinking about the margin progression as we think about the humira loe in a couple of years? and then as we sort of get past that and your sales start to ramp up again, if you could maybe give us some sense of where you think your margins could sort of come back to? and then the other one i have is just on vraylar. again, i appreciate the guidance you've given there. i think one of the big events for you guys is you'll be the phase 3 data in mdd.
i'm just curious kind of what gives you confidence and maybe you can just talk about whether it's around the drug or the study design? sort of what gives you confidence or why should we be confident sort of going into that data readout? thanks.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
vamil, this is rob. i'll take your question on margin progression. i think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from allergan by next year and the p&l leverage that will come from the sales growth that we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through '22. upon the entry of u.s.
biosimilars in '23 and given humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin and pullback. we've indicated before, the 45% range. based on our current lrp, i think it will be a little bit higher than that. but then when we return to growth immediately -- in '24, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in '25, you can expect then operating margins once again expand.
we've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the p&l. and i would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in '25 and beyond.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yes, vamil, this is rick. mike and i will cover the second question on vraylar. it's important to recognize that what we've communicated in long-term guidance on vraylar is based on the three currently approved indications. so it doesn't count on the fact that mdd would be successful.
now, having said that, i think we do have, i'd say, we're cautiously optimistic about the mdd indication and i'll let mark kind of walk through how we look at it and what gives us that level of confidence. but in the event it weren't to play out, that doesn't impact the guidance that we gave.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so this is mike. i'll pick up from here. i think that our optimism, and i think that's the right way to express it in a disease like mdd, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. one is based on the basic pharmacology of vraylar, which has a unique mix of d3, d2, specificity, and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings.
it's also driven by the results that we have from the mdd study that is positive that we already have in hand. so with one positive study, we would need only one, at least one or, of course, both of the next two studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. we've done a deep dive into the study design in the patient population. we think it's a well-designed study.
and we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study. and we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study roles for the conduct of the study. and so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work. well-designed study, well-conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results.
but as i mentioned, mdd is a challenging area. and for that reason, we didn't build it into our deal model, and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as rick said. so we view this as upside.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, vamil. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. and our next question is from randall stanicky from rbc capital markets.
randall stanicky -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. back to rinvoq in atopic derm, how quickly do you guys expect that launch to ramp? and maybe just help us with expectations given coinciding jak competition from abrocitinib, the timing to payer ramp, and coverage. and then we sense a lot of patient warehousing, maybe if you could help quantify your thinking around that opportunity within the $1.7 billion outlook for the year, that would be helpful. and then a quick follow-up, rick, you don't get asked about eye care a lot.
it's a $3 billion global franchise. you have some pipeline behind it. it could be a good growth business, but it's declining. any appetite to strategically add to that business or reposition it? or should we view it more as a mature cash flow generator? thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. hi. it's jeffrey stewart. i'll start off with the atopic derm commercial question.
we're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter, and i'll give you some context there. so when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least two and probably closer to 3 times the size of the psoriasis market. and so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. it's also significantly underpenetrated.
i mean, if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single digits, the low single digits, where we are right now with the one biologic, dupilumab. so it's very, very attractive. the other thing that i would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know that hcps very intimately. so about 85% of the market is driven by the derms.
we know the derms very well, and there's a roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like skyrizi and/or humira. so we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. to get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know, with rinvoq right now in the existing indication of ra. we have greater than 95% commercial access.
that's the dominant channel for atopic derm. and our anticipation is we will have very strong access that will build to that level over the course of '21. obviously, it's going to take some time once we get the approval, to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans. and so we see it starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year.
so the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment, as well as the allergy segment, give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
the only thing i would add to jeff's comments, i mean, if you look at rinvoq, it did $731 million last year. obviously, if you look at the running rate, so out of the fourth quarter, had a strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter. but that's $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. the majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in ra.
i think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the ra market. it takes time for physicians to start to adapt it. once they do, their momentum picks up. so i don't remember the specific number, and i'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway.
but i would be thinking about it more that it's continued penetration and growth in ra that's driving the bulk of that growth. rob, anything you want to add?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. just on your question regarding warehouse patients, we have a very modest amount of warehouse patients assumed in the forecast. so the $1.7 billion doesn't really count on that. and keep in mind that rinvoq was one of the products that was lesser impacted by covid.
and so there's not really a significant warehousing in that forecast.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and then, randall, on your second question, i would say we absolutely agree with your point of view. i think eye care is a very attractive market. it's the kinds of markets that i think we look for and that we -- the very best at is where there are specialized physicians who really drive the use of medications based on the clinical data and being able to restate markets and improve standard of care in those markets. and certainly, eye care, i think, fits that description.
so we would have a strong appetite to look for opportunities, and we are looking for opportunities now. if we could add to that eye care business to be able to drive growth. obviously, restasis, as rob indicated in his formal remarks, we've built in a half a year, that's still an unknown of when that product will go generic or if it will go generic. but i think even aside from that, regardless of what happens with restasis, longer term, this is an area that we would have interest.
and if we could find the right kind of assets to add to it, we would enthusiastically do that.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, randall. operator, next question, please.
operator
and our next question is from chris schott from j.p. morgan.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan
great. thanks so much for the questions. can you just elaborate a little bit more on aesthetics? and maybe some of the learnings you've had in that franchise since you acquired it, have there been changes in the way you think about approaching the business commercially, your levels of investment? i'm just trying to get my hands around that high single-digit growth over time. it does seem healthier than the street had been anticipating.
i'm just trying to get a little bit more color of what you're seeing in the market that gives you confidence in that. and then my second question was just on imbruvica. the growth has slowed here a bit. can you just elaborate a bit more on how much of this is -- is there any covid-related dynamics playing out here? how much of this is competitive? i'm just trying to get a sense of just how you're seeing the health of that franchise over time.
thanks so much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. chris, this is rick. so i'll cover the aesthetics question for you. i'd say as we've studied the aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, i think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market.
i would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation. and i would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for. and we think that will -- certainly, you can see the response, like as an example, in botox, already, we're seeing a very aggressive response and being able to grow the market. you saw the botox cosmetics grew in the fourth quarter, 9%.
i would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. and as part of legacy allergan, i think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter to quarter where we have -- we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a long period of time. i'd say the second thing that's of interest to us is i think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation if you fund that innovation in a way again, a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively and have a well-thought-out strategic road map as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. as mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time.
and the same with the filler market. there are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you can use fillers, both within the u.s. and globally. and that's a significant opportunity.
but long term, we think there's an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at abbvie and create more biologically active fillers that not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin, and other kinds of characteristics that would improve skin quality. and we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. and then the last thing i'd say is the geographic footprint that abbvie has. we obviously have a very broad geographic footprint.
and the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating in the aesthetics business, really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. a good case in point is, i believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in china to be able to increase the sales force there, to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in china to the next level down. and we're already seeing the benefits of that. china is already back to growing much like it did pre-covid.
so i think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. on imbruvica, maybe jeff and i will tag-team on that one. what we're clearly seeing is that covid is having an impact on patient starts in cll. we're not only seeing it in imbruvica, but we're seeing it in venclexta as well.
and it's somewhat logical when you think about it, these oncology practices are trying to reduce density and cll is a disease where you can -- in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. i would say that's the vast majority of it. when we look at -- when i look at the overall share and the reason why i'm talking about the overall share is venclexta is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. when i look at our overall shares in first line, second line, or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position.
and i'd say probably partially to your question, if i look at calquence, i'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. i think the first-line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line, maybe 14%. and i don't recall the third-line share.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
very similar, yeah.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so i'd say that's within the range of what we saw with mcl within the range of what we had modeled. so it's not really a competitive issue that we're dealing with. it's more a function of getting those patients starts back up to the level they were before. anything you want to add, jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
no. i think, rick, that's exactly right. the only thing i would say in terms of our forecast, we think that in the first part of the year, the early part of the year, we'll continue to see some suppression in the new patient starts. but as we hit the second and third quarter, we anticipate that the market will recover.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question is from tim anderson from wolfe research.
nicole maher -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. can you hear me? this is nicole maher on for tim anderson. what does your long-term guidance assume for potential austerity measures in the ex-u.s. countries in 2021 and beyond? similar to what we saw in the post-2008 time period, except this time around it would be the follow-up from the covid impact?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hey, nicole. this is rick. i think this is something we've had experience with. if you think about the economic crisis, i thought we saw a similar kind of uptick in price erosion outside the united states and in particular, i'd say, in european union.
we have factored in a reasonable assumption into our guidance for 2021. so i feel good about that. i think it is reflective of what we're likely to see. so i think we're covered from that perspective.
anything you want to add, rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. that covers it.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, nicole. operator, next question, please.
operator
and our next question is from steve scala from cowen.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. two questions. abbvie delivered one of the first completely clean and compelling quarters in pharma this cycle and i have to believe has something in reserve for upside as the year unfolds. i'm sure you monitor the competition.
so beyond the abbvie management team itself, what about your business? do you think is allowing you to execute in this way? would you attribute it mainly to the products themselves, the payer strategies, geographic mix? or is there something else? and the second question is the ongoing vraylar phase 3 trials utilize doses up to 3 milligrams, while the successful prior trials were up to 4.5 milligrams. so why were the doses lowered in the first place? and what placebo response mitigation methods are included in the ongoing trials? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. steve, this is rick. i'll cover the first one and mike can cover the second one. i would say first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace.
we tend to probably even to some extent, obsessively plan and go out and try to execute against that plan. and i think in times of difficulties, that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself. and that's where you see the biggest differences. so that's not to say other people don't do it.
like that. i'm not that familiar with how others operate, but i know how we operate. and i know how we contingency plan, and we look at, ok, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? and we do that ahead of time. and if that doesn't work, what are we going to do? and i think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful.
i'd say the second thing is if i look at our business, we put a strategy in place, and i feel very good about how the business is performing overall. i mean, i would say the business firing on all cylinders. and you can look at our fourth-quarter performance, to your point. and i think it demonstrates that, and you can look at our guidance, and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was.
and that, i think, is another indicator for you. and we have a much more diverse business now. we have four major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. our new product launches are doing extremely well.
obviously, skyrizi and rinvoq are, but i'd also say ubrelvy and vraylar are performing extremely well. and the pipeline, i would say one of the things that gives me the most confidence is when i look at the pipeline behind that, that's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because one of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level it's performing over the long term. and so if i look -- i look at the skyrizi and rinvoq, r&d execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular, both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. when i look at our hem/onc strategy, we've got a very disciplined strategy there of ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow what has become a very large franchise for us.
our franchise is $6.6 billion, as we said, we're going to grow at double digits. over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? well, obviously, imbruvica is going to continue to drive share, venclexta is going to continue to drive share in cll. but venclexta has indication expansions into area potential, in areas like t(11;14) and a broader aml population and several other areas. then i look at navitoclax.
we should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis. and then you look at genmab and you look at our cd47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. neuroscience, same thing. atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population.
so i feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. so i think there's not one silver bullet that i can point to. i think it's all of those things. certainly, our ability and market access has helped a lot in the u.s.
i'd say we're very good at that. but you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. you have to have assets that are differentiated, like skyrizi and rinvoq. so it's the combination of all of that, it gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance.
and i feel awfully good about where we are.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so this is mike. i'll take the vraylar question. i believe you're talking about the ongoing mdd studies. and what i would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose response, not only from the prior mdd studies, but across the program, and we've done a deep dive into that, and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in this indication.
with respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. and i would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. the first and most important is appropriate site selection. one has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting.
and that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. the next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design, and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post-registration if the study is successful. and we've taken a look at all of these things. we've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data, and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from gary nachman from bmo capital markets.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. could you talk about how much more you plan on investing behind the neuroscience franchise to accelerate growth there? to get to the long-term targets, you talked about like the $4 billion in vraylar, even without mdd, and how you see the long-term potential in botox therapeutic? and then how are you thinking about the launch for atogepant later this year? and how will you leverage the work that you've done so far with ubrelvy, how do you think that product will take off in the migraine market? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, i'd say on the on the neuroscience investment, i mean, we obviously have a very broad neuroscience investment. i mean, we have a significant investment from an r&d standpoint and in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. so i'd say we have a significant r&d investment. we obviously are investing in vraylar to continue to expand that asset.
again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum market share capture. i think if you look at vraylar and you look at the projections that we've made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. and basically, we've been able to sustain that, and we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual in this market because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. so we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in.
same thing on botox therapeutic. obviously, we have r&d programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics. anything you want to add from an investment standpoint, rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think if you look at the overall portfolio, we've detailed out what we expect for vraylar, and that's without the additional indication, we think we can get to approaching $4 billion. when we look at the migraine portfolio, peak sales are greater than $1 billion for both the ubrelvy and atogepant. we have 951 in the pipeline that we think can be a significant contributor. obviously, botox therapeutic will continue to grow.
so we feel pretty good about the portfolio we have, and that double-digit growth outlook is supported by a number of very promising assets.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. hi, it's jeff. i'll take the second question on atogepant. i think, first, the asset itself is very, very attractive.
and when you look at the response on the migraine-free days at the 10 to the 60 milligram, it's really impressive data. very impressive data as this very strong oral. and so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. obviously, you highlighted the leveraging ubrelvy.
we've got dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists, as well as the headache specialists. they'll actually carry both ubrelvy and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focused on the big primary care writers that see a lot of the migraine sufferers. so this is an important dynamic that we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market toward the end of the year. also, we're looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey.
so patients are on botox therapeutic, for example, which is very substantial. it's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. but many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. so ultimately, the combination of botox plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long-term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's ubrelvy on the front end with acute, atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or botox on the back end.
we think it's a nice portfolio that we can commercially manage over time to hit our ambitions that rob described.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, gary. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. and our next question is from navin jacob from ubs.
navin jacob -- ubs -- analyst
hi. navin from ubs. thanks for taking the question. so first, on the adc steroid, adc for inflammatory conditions.
just wanted to get an update there. it's been, i believe you said delayed for covid-19. do you still believe that this approach can lead to success in -- for refractory ra or other inflammatory conditions? just wondering about your confidence in this technology, understanding it's still early in development. and then secondly, as it relates to your current state of affairs with rinvoq and skyrizi, could you remind us of what the current in play market share for rinvoq is in ra and skyrizi in psoriasis? thank you so much.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
ok. this is mike. i'll take your first question. abbv-154, our tnf steroid conjugate, has not been delayed because of covid.
there were some delays in other early immunology programs, our cd40 and our rorgamma t program experienced modest delays but 154 did not. as we said at the time of the covid peak over the course of the last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment. the programs that i'm talking about, cd40 and rorgamma t were impacted modestly in that time period, but 154 was not. so that remains on track.
we remain confident in it. we have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. remember that we had 2, 3373, and 154, and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology. we're planning to initiate a large phase 2b study in the first half of this year.
and then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying phase 2 crohn's disease, as well as polymyalgia rheumatica. and so that's an important set of indications. it covers a wide range of opportunities, ra and crohn's disease are areas where we're very active. pmr, polymyalgia rheumatica, is a new area where there's not a lot of therapeutics.
unfortunately, it's a well-established area in medicine, but there's very little in terms of treatment for these patients. they have considerable pain and suffering from their conditions, and it's particularly steroid responsive. so we think it is a very attractive target for a steroid adc approach. so 154 remains on track, and we continue to have confidence in it.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thanks, mike. it's jeff. i'll take the in-play share. so if we look at the psoriasis market and skyrizi, we have on our latest data point 33% of in play share, which is, of course, is new patients coming in or newly switched patients.
if you look at the total abbvie share, it's approximately 45%. so very remarkable when you add humira plus skyrizi in the dermatology space. if you look at the ra space, our latest data points are between 15% and 16% in terms of in-play share for rinvoq in ra, and that's basically neck and neck with humira. so for a total abbvie share of roughly a third of the ra market.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. the only thing i'd add on that is when you look at that skyrizi 33% in play share, it's almost double what the next closest competitor is. i mean, it's impressive the gap between skyrizi and the no. 2 player.
and the other thing is, as these brands get more experience in the market, we'll also start to talk about the total trx share. and i think skyrizi is at that point now. i think it's total trx share. now, it's 14%, 13.9%, 14%, something like that.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that's right.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and that's pretty impressive for this short period of time. i think it's close to no. 2 in the market in trx share. so they're both doing very, very well.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, navin. operator, next question, please.
operator
and the next question is from chris raymond from piper sandler.
chris raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thanks. just a couple of questions. first, on the relationship with bi on skyrizi.
we had a few inbound questions on the treatment of the royalty, and i know you've answered this question a little bit in the past, but also just noticing the big noncash gaap charge you took this quarter. you back out of non-gaap earnings. so i know you have described accounting for this as a business combination. but can you maybe give a little bit more color on the rationale and the accounting behind that noncash charge? and then is there also some threshold number or other event where you'd add this royalty expense back to non-gaap? and then on abbv-951, we picked up a decent amount of kol excitement around this asset in parkinson's.
i know phase 3 is expected later this year. but i wonder if you could maybe talk about the launch, your launch expectations on this and maybe contrast it to the duodopa experience. just from our feedback, it seems like this could expand the addressable pd population pretty sizably. and i don't know, rick, maybe frame how this sort of factors into your long-range $10 billion neuroscience guidance? thanks.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. chris, i'll take your question on contingent consideration. so yes, we did account for this as a business combination. so that means each quarter, we do mark-to-market the fair value of the future milestone royalty payments.
and you did see us take a fair value write-up this quarter based on the higher sales outlook, as we communicated during the immunology day event in december and that you see in the guidance we provide today. obviously, the outlook for skyrizi continues to increase, and so we're recognizing that liability going forward. we also take into consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. so it's not just our own forecast, it's also what street expectations are.
and those have also increased, as we've seen a very nice ramp. we're starting to see, obviously, the confidence from the street increase, and that's translate into a higher outlook for skyrizi, which then translates to higher future potential royalties. one of the reasons i wanted to stress also on the free cash flow in my remarks today, is because there is some confusion over -- that's how we account for it, but it's important to keep in mind that when i talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments to bi. and so you can look at a few different ways.
you can look at it from a -- if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully, what does that contribute to overall cash flow. so we would not be going back. we made a determination as a business combination. we should not anticipate that we would reverse that.
but we'll provide, obviously, more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
i mean, i'll also say in that time period when we did bi, it was an absolute requirement on the accounting --
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. that was clear.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
it wasn't like it was a judgment call or something you desire to do. the accounting said it had to be accounted for in that form, in that fashion. it's since been changed going forward, but the window at which that occurred, that was the required accounting treatment. so on number two, jeff and i will cover number two.
i'll give you sort of a high-level look, and then jeff, maybe give you more specificity around it. if you look at duodopa, i mean, this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy. you can see these patients who cannot move, really, and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug. and within a very short period of time, they regained their motion.
the challenge is a very difficult treatment to -- for the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long-term sustainable basis. you have to do surgery, insert the g-tube, you have to maintain that g-tube open. so that does somewhat limit the population that is able to use it. and so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market.
and jeff is obviously far more familiar with it, so i'll let him give you a little more specifics. but that's the general concept. i think this could be a significant -- wanted to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy; and two, i think you could expand the market pretty significantly.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. i think just to add on that, rick, we hear the same thing from our kols. they're very, very encouraged. and with the perspective, you look at duopa or duodopa about a $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on onboarding for these patients, right? you have to do the jpeg surgery.
you have challenges with the size of the pump. nonetheless, it's so remarkable that we do get that level of sales. so if i give you some perspective on the market, if you look at the advanced parkinson's disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any relief. and then they're still in big trouble.
so only a minority, about 10% ever get to, let's say, more advanced device-aided therapy, which is duopa or duodopa and deep brain stimulation. so as we study the market, we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way, a simple way for a neurologist to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure. whether it's brain surgery or the gi surgery, we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of the really nonworkable oral segment. so we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our kols and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for our launch in the coming years.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question, please.
operator
and our next question is from greg gilbert from truist.
greg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
yes. hi. i was curious if your botox cosmetic guidance in the u.s. assumes that jeuveau is on the market or off the market this year? and then longer term, curious about botox cosmetic versus therapeutic.
many years ago, allergan started to explore the idea of separating the two from a reimbursement and pricing standpoint. i believe it involved litigation with the government at one point. but i don't know if that's still ongoing or if you're still thinking through that possibility since it has implications longer-term about keeping those assets together or possibly spinning aesthetics someday if conditions warrant. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. so i don't know that we're going to specifically comment on what we've assumed as it relates to jeuveau. i just don't think it's probably appropriate. first of all, it's not that large of a product so it wouldn't have a material impact on botox cosmetics.
i'd say on your second question, i will tell you emphatically we have no interest in spinning off the aesthetics business. we have a program in place where we manage the differences between the reimbursement associated with botox therapeutics and the cash paid portion of the cosmetics business. it's been in place for quite some time. we're quite comfortable that we can manage it quite effectively.
so it's an important thing that you track carefully, but we have a good system in place to be able to do that. but we have no interest in spinning off the aesthetics business or any aspects of the aesthetics business.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, greg. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question is from geoffrey meacham from bank of america.
aspen mori -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys, it's aspen on for jeff. a couple of quick ones. so within the context of the xeljanz data, do you guys have an early view from the field as to whether docs are differentiating rinvoq and -- sorry, rinvoq and xeljanz safety profiles? and then quickly on the mid- to early stage pipeline. there's obviously a lot going on in your hem/onc space.
but i just want to get a sense of how strategically important some more newer disruptive technologies are to abbvie such as cell or gene therapy? thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. i'll take the early view from the field. i think it's important, at least we've heard from our teams that some of this data is not really new. it was available in the interim analysis that help led to the label that we have.
and so really, the early reports from our field, particularly from the kols and the big prescribers is a little bit of a shoulder shrug, like not that new news. i would say from the standpoint of the comparison between rinvoq and xeljanz. i mean, if you look at the penetration of the jak class, really across the world and particularly in the u.s., there has been a significant lift that we just talked about with that in play share. and so really, what we're hearing from the field and from the prescribers are they view rinvoq as a differentiated asset in terms of the overall risk-benefit, and that's why that share is moving so quickly.
and so that's really what we hear in the early days from our teams that are connected to those big rheumatologists.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so this is mike. i'll take the question on the hem/onc portfolio, mid-stage, and newer technologies. what i would say is there is a lot going on in our hem/onc portfolio. obviously, with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage, i think you'll see a focus on t cell redirection, which is, of course, a newer technology.
and i think, a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers. and you see good progress with our cd3xcd20 and our bcma t-cell redirecting therapies. and so that is clearly an area of focus for us now, and i think we'll continue to be in the future. with respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing, it can be used in different ways.
gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies, and we have early programs in cell-based therapies in hem/onc and in other areas, solid tumor oncology, and potentially other areas in the future. and so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. i think that for those sorts of approaches were probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable, but we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next-generation needs.
and so we are keeping a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. what i mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. we don't find a tool and then figure out how to use it. and so in each of these cases, we're going after strong biology.
we're going after we think we'll raise the bar on the standard of care. and i think a number of the newer technologies that i mentioned fit that bill.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, austin. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
thank you. our final question today is from luisa hector from berenberg.
luisa hector -- berenberg -- analyst
hello. thank you for taking my question, and thank you for the guidance on the cost lines. and i just wondered, given that we have various layers to consider with covid and then the allergan inclusion and the synergies, could you comment on the implied cost ratios for 2021? and how representative these are of the combined entity? and is there anything else we should be thinking about for those cost lines as we look out to '22 covid-related savings maybe sticky, maybe ones that may reverse? and could you tell us the level of synergies you achieved already in 2020? thank you.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, luisa. this is rob. so i think now that we have our first full year with the combined company and you're looking at these profiles, i think you could assume they're indicative of -- in the range of what you'd expect going forward. and so this is probably a cleaner guide than, say, when you have a partial year like we had in 2020.
as it relates to the synergies we achieved in 2020, we achieved about $600 million of synergies, about $400 million, that was in r&d and $200 million in sg&a. and you see we've increased that to $1.7 billion in 2021 with about a little bit -- roughly half of that coming from r&d about in the 40% range, sg&a and about 10% coming from cost of goods.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, luisa. and that concludes today's conference call. if you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. thanks again for joining us.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; and rob michael, executive vice president and chief financial officer. joining us for the q&a portion of the call is jeff stewart, executive vice president, commercial operations. before we get started, i remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on abbvie's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 annual report on form 10-k and in our other sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, as in the past, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's ongoing business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full year, full current year, and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of zenpep and viokace. references to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange.
following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 performance, as well as our expectations for 2021. mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail.
following our remarks, we'll take your questions. we delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. fourth-quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. this performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc, and neuroscience franchises, as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of botox cosmetics, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery.
our fourth-quarter performance tops off another excellent and truly transformational year for abbvie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse abbvie; with leadership across numerous attractive, high-growth markets; significant contributions from our two new best-in-category immunology medicines, rinvoq and skyrizi, which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. we expect the combined contribution from rinvoq and skyrizi to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion, based on their continued strong uptake in ra and psoriasis, as well as rinvoq's anticipated approvals in psa, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis later this year. we delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with imbruvica and venclexta contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. we expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021.
we also added two compelling oncology pipeline assets: epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class cd3xcd20 bispecific antibody in development for b-cell malignancies; and lemzoparlimab, an anti-cd47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. these two assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan. the acquisition of allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions, augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. the newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021.
we also added the leading global aesthetics franchise, a largely cash paid portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. as i've previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid v-shaped recovery, and we view aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. and importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. we expect our r&d pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including a total of six additional indications for rinvoq and skyrizi, which will cover all of humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis; expanded indications for venclexta and vraylar and several new product approvals, including atogepant, for episodic migraine, navitoclax for myelofibrosis and abbv-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced parkinson's disease.
these new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the u.s. humira loe. we've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full-year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4%, with total abbvie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus.
and we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. this level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. the allergan integration continues to go very well. the transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the covid pandemic.
while we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous allergan growth platforms. as we recently disclosed, we believe ubrelvy, the first-to-market and leading oral cgrp for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity; atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. we expect vraylar peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar i disorder, and bipolar depression. with major depressive disorder, or mdd, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity.
aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year, is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. we continue to closely monitor the covid dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. and despite the recent covid resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global healthcare system is much better equipped with covid treatment protocols and ppe to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year. that said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like cll, hcv, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance.
overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. so in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets, and the outlook for abbvie's business remains strong, with rinvoq and skyrizi expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025, and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience, and aesthetics. we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the humira loe impact in 2023 supporting an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d programs.
mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
thank you, rick. we've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with imbruvica and venclexta and in immunology with rinvoq and skyrizi. since inception, our r&d organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. we also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs, with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years.
we will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for abbvie in the second half of the decade. at our recent immunology investor event in december, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to date for rinvoq and skyrizi across approved and pipeline indications. included in this event, we presented positive top-line data from two new phase 3 studies for rinvoq, results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilimab and atopic dermatitis. we expect to see results from the second phase 3 uc induction study later this quarter and from the uc maintenance study in the middle of this year.
with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. our regulatory applications for rinvoq in atopic dermatitis are currently under review, and we expect an approval decision in the u.s. in the second quarter based on priority review and in europe in the second half of the year. we recently received european commission approval for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the u.s.
in the first half of this year. i want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically mace and malignancies, following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. at present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study apply to a specific jak1 inhibitor such as rinvoq. we are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of mace or malignancies with rinvoq or any jak inhibitor other than xeljanz.
we conducted a pool database analysis across our clinical trials for dvt, mace, and malignancies at the time of rinvoq's regulatory submission and have updated it periodically, including up to the present. rates with rinvoq have not been elevated relative to comparators or to expected baseline rates. importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. additionally, we adjudicate events for mace and dvt, which is considered the highest standard of evidence.
if we look across our long-term database in ra, a population that is at increased risk for mace events, our rates remain low. at the approved dose in ra, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients, totaling more than 9,000 patient-years' experience. our rate of mace events is 0.4 per 100 patient-years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events per 100 patient-years. in addition, there is no evidence of a dose response between the 15- and 30-milligram doses.
similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up, is 0.8 events per 100 patient-years. this rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100 patient-years. and again, we see no evidence of a dose response between 15 and 30 milligrams. moving now to skyrizi.
we also recently reported top-line results from the phase 3 programs for skyrizi in crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. in the two crohn's induction studies, skyrizi demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week 4. based on the data generated today, we believe skyrizi has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe crohn's disease. we expect to see results from the maintenance study in crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021.
we're also very pleased with skyrizi's results in the phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. we believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the skyrizi program, make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. we plan to submit our regulatory applications for skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. we're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well, where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021.
we expect to begin three new studies for abbv-154, our tnf steroid conjugate, including a phase 2b dose-ranging study in ra, as well as phase 2 studies in crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. and we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for ravagalimab, our cd40 antagonist in phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and for abbv-157, our oral rorgamma t inhibitor in phase 1 for psoriasis. both of these programs experienced slight covid-related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. in oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year, as well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including genmab's cd3xcd20 epcoritamab and i-mab's anti-cd47 lemzoparlimab.
we showcased new data from several programs at the recent ash meeting, where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from eight different assets. notable presentations included: data from the phase 2 captivate trial, evaluating imbruvica plus venclexta in frontline cll, which showed patients who achieved undetectable mrd following this combination, maintain their deep remission at the one-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease-free survival. we also presented new five-year data from venclexta's murano trial, demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration venclexta combinations in helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. the latest results from murano in the relapsed/refractory cll setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the venclexta and rituximab group compared to 17 months in the bendamustine rituximab group, three or more years after stopping treatment.
updated dose-escalation data from a phase 1 study evaluating epcoritamab in b-cell malignancies were also presented at ash. epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific cd3xcd20 antibody being developed in collaboration with genmab. in the phase 1 study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single-agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile, showing no grade 3 or higher crs events, as well as limited neurotoxicity. we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of b-cell malignancies, including diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
the phase 3 trial in relapsed refractory, dlbcl, recently began, and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. initial results were also presented from a phase 1 study evaluating tnb-383b in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. tnb-383b is a novel bispecific t-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting bcma and cd3 being developed in collaboration with teneobio. these phase 1 results demonstrated that the bcma cd3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80%, with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy.
tnb-383b was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no grade 3 or higher crs observed. with its safety profile, efficacy, and the convenience of once-every-three-week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. and our partner, i-mab, published an abstract with initial results from a phase 1 study evaluating lemzoparlimab in aml and mds. these results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed/refractory aml patients.
and lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in aml, mds, and in multiple myeloma. we also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a phase 2 study, evaluating teliso-v in heavily pretreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. the encouraging results from stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program, with teliso-v demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type egfr who have highly expressed cmet.
in egfr wild-type patients with overexpressed cmet, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for teliso-v in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer population. we will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. we expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline, with several regulatory submissions, as well as data readouts across all stages of development.
this year, we expect to see data for imbruvica in the phase 3 shine study in frontline mcl with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year, data for imbruvica in combination with venclexta in second-line or greater mcl, and frontline cll with regulatory submission for frontline cll expected in the second half of the year. we also expect to see data from registration-enabling studies for venclexta in high-risk mds and navitoclax in relapsed/refractory myelofibrosis, and we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early stage oncology pipeline. in addition, the programs under collaboration with calico are also progressing well. our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development.
importantly, we currently have programs which have advanced into clinical development in two areas: immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. the lead calico program in oncology is focused on ptpn2 inhibitors. which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. the discovery of novel, orally bioavailable ptpn2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough in a target class that has historically been considered undruggable.
we currently have two assets in phase 1 development, abbv-cls-579 and 484. we've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway, and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. the lead calico program in neuroscience is an eif2b activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as als and parkinson's disease, as well as in traumatic brain injury.
our lead eif2b activator, abbv-cls-7262 is currently progressing through phase 1 and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with als. in other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention. and we recently submitted our regulatory application to the fda. we expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter.
the data generated in our phase 3 programs support a strong benefit-risk profile. and we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. in 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from two phase 3 studies for vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for abbv-951 in advanced parkinson's disease, with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. we also expect to see proof-of-concept data for elezanumab in a phase 2 study in multiple sclerosis and abbv-8e12, our lead anti-tau antibody, in a phase 2 study in alzheimer's disease.
in addition to 8e12, we have a number of promising approaches in alzheimer's, including our neuroinflammation programs aimed at trem2 and cd33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. these include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity, as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. in aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers, with several regulatory submissions, data readouts, and pivotal study starts expected this year. our programs include new indications for botox, as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations in both long and short-acting toxins.
we also have programs to develop new indications for the juvãderm collection, as well as novel dermal fillers such as harmonyca, which will be entering registration-enabling studies in the u.s. and in eye care, based on the positive results from the phase 3 studies evaluating our topical eye drop, agn-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. we plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. so in summary, our r&d productivity remained high last year despite multiple covid-related challenges, and we were able to maintain study continuity and minimize delays.
we're entering 2021 well-positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline again this year. this includes five new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts, and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our fourth-quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. starting with fourth-quarter results. we once again delivered strong top- and bottom-line performance. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08.
total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. within immunology, humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit growth in the u.s. offset by biosimilar competition across international markets.
skyrizi sales were $525 million, and rinvoq sales were $281 million, with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from imbruvica and venclexta. aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion, with botox cosmetic and juvãderm, both experiencing a rapid recovery from the covid pandemic. neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by vraylar and our migraine portfolio.
we also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. turning now to the p&l profile for the fourth quarter. adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales. adjusted r&d investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense was 22.3% of sales.
the adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. net interest expense was $618 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. as we look ahead to 2021, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items.
we expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. this forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. we expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including u.s.
humira growth of approximately 8%, international humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, skyrizi global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, and rinvoq global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. we expect hematologic oncology to grow double digits, with imbruvica global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and venclexta global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. for aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from botox cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from juvãderm. for neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including botox therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion, and ubrelvy sales of approximately $400 million.
for eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. for women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. for our remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from mavyret, $1.2 billion from creon, $1 billion from linzess, $800 million from synthroid, and $750 million from lupron. looking at the p&l for 2021, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales.
adjusted r&d investment of approximately $6.6 billion, and adjusted sg&a expense of approximately $11.8 billion. this guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the allergan acquisition. we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. we expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion.
our non-gaap tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to q4 2020. as we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, and we model a non-gaap tax rate of 12.3%.
we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. finally, abbvie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. our cash balance at the end of december was $8.4 billion, and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. this fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020.
we expect to achieve a net debt-to-ebitda ratio just below 2.5x by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. we anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid- to late-stage assets. in closing, we are very pleased with abbvie's strong performance in 2020.
we've driven top-tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities, and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. operator, first question, please.
",2020-Q4,ABBV
,,,,":
operator
our first question comes from chris schott of j.p. morgan. your line is open.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the questions. the first one for me was on rinvoq and dose. as we think about fda, i guess, balancing the lowest effective dose versus incremental efficacy and safety risks.
i guess what would the impact of only having a 15-milligram versus a 15-milligram and 30-milligram approval have on your view on the atopic dermatitis opportunity, which i think you talked about is about $2 billion sales potential previously? and my second question was just a little bit more color on the aesthetic dynamics. i guess is there anything we're seeing with the results, which seem very, very strong here. is there any catch-up-type event as the world reopens that we're seeing with these results or is -- or are these kind of sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations of that business? just trying to get a sense of just how to think about that progressing as we go through the rest of the year. thanks so much.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
thanks, chris. this is mike, i'll take the first question and then rick will take the second question that you asked. with respect to rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we've studied. having said, that both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective.
and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms, with 15 as well as with 30. and with the 15-milligram dose, for example, we start seeing a statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. and again, that's really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. so we think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically.
but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk in both doses. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
chris, this is rick. i'll cover the aesthetics one for you as mike said. i think if you look at the underlying performance of the aesthetics business in particular the market growth in the u.s. and in china, it's driving the fundamental growth that we see through the business.
certainly, there is some impact still from covid. so we're seeing some impact there but i think the majority of it is when we took over allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in a prior. and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that will fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. and i think the best comparisons are starting to look at what it looks like versus 2019 because you obviously have covid impact in 2020.
but you take, for example, botox, botox versus 2019 -- cosmetic botox versus 2019 is up about 27%. the market is growing very robustly. some of that is probably covid driven, it's the u.s. numbers i'm describing right now.
some of that is probably covid driven but i wouldn't say a lot of it at this point is covid driven in the u.s. china continues to grow very well. in fact, i could say china is back to the level of growth and we have expanded the sales force in china once about four or five months ago. we're in the process now of going through the second expansion in china.
i would expect that china will continue to drive significant growth going forward. the one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from covid is the european market. we still see it starting -- we see it's starting to emerge in areas like the u.k. but there are other areas in europe that are still on lockdown.
i would expect that europe and brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. but i would tell you, i'm very pleased with the decisions we've made around driving more promotion and i'm pleased with the execution of this team. this team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want. but i think it is sustainable going forward.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rick. operator, next question, please. 
operator
yes, our next question comes from geoffrey porges with svb leerink. your line is open.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you very much. i appreciate it. a couple of questions. first, rick, something we don't talk about a lot is the neuroscience portfolio and you've started reporting it combined.
i know there are four products in there but adding them up the long-term guidance you provided previously was about $8.3 billion, i think, and you already annualize it close to six. so could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has given the trends that you're seeing? and then, sort of unrelated question. i hate to hop on the jak question but obviously, there's a lot coming to us from what this impact might be. so if you were confined to the 15-milligram dose, not because of any signal but because of the regulators' view of the safety of the class, how much impact will that have on the $8 billion long-term guidance? and do you have other levers that you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause? thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
on the neuroscience portfolio, it is an area that we're very excited about. so maybe jeff and i are tag team here. but i think when you look at the two major growth franchises there being the migrating franchise and the antipsychotic franchise with vraylar, both of those, we think, have significant opportunities to continue to grow. i mean, you're obviously seeing ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace.
i'll give you a little more color on that. and vraylar is continuing to perform very well as well. i think if we are able to achieve one positive study on mdd, i think that will give us significant growth going forward. so this is a franchise that we're excited about.
i think it will be a meaningful franchise for us over the long term, it's an area where we continue to look at assets that we could potentially add to it. and i think it'll be a nice growth driver for us. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. i think just to reiterate, as i mentioned in my comments, you know, the oral cgrp market is moving very nicely it's hit -- i mentioned 16% for the quarter but now in the weeklies, it's 17% or above on just the penetration of that segment. and so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long-range planning. certainly, the availability of another oral cgrp, in this case for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute.
and to rick's point, remember, we have the big anchor asset with botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraines. and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraines. and this is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for atogepant. and so when you look basically really across the waterfront, you know, leading acute agent, oral -- very, very potent an active oral agent in the middle with episodic and then on the back end with botox, it's a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth.
and as rick mentioned, you know, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive mdd. and that segment itself, when we do the market analysis, is about as large, the adjunctive mdd segment, as bipolar depression. and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long-range plan. so we're very encouraged over this set of assets.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and jeff, this is ron. i would just add if you take the pieces we've given in terms of long-term guidance, for vraylar we've talked about approaching $4 billion with the currently approved indications for migraines. both ubrelvy and atogepant, we've talked about key potential greater than a billion for each of those assets. and then we have duopa plus, we've 951 in the pipeline that i think can drive significant growth in addition to our early stage pipeline neuroscience.
so i do see that as a therapeutic area that will drive long-term growth for the company going forward. 
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great, thanks. and then to jak?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
you know on the jak, we've obviously evaluated carefully the positioning of the product. i think if we look at where we are today, we're more confident in the high dose that has a good risk-benefit profile. but i would tell you it wouldn't change our guidance going forward. the assumptions that we have made in areas like atopic dermatitis we believe we can get to those assumptions without the high dose.
that doesn't mean that we don't want a high dose. but at the end of the day, i believe we can -- we will maintain the guidance that we have based on that. 
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
the other thing that i would point out is that we've had additional data on the upadacitinib rinvoq across a number of areas since that guidance including ibd. so we've had the uc data that have come largely since that guidance and those have exceeded our expectations. and so we remain confident overall in the performance of rinvoq.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks, jeff.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, jeffrey. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew baum with citi. your line is open.many thanks. a couple of questions, please.
there's not much bipartisan agreements and the u.s. have a drug price reform. but there seems to be a lot when it comes to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry. so, perhaps rick could comment following last night's house committee on the judiciary where there was lots of pointed talk from both sides focusing firstly on patent tickets, second on having a presumption of anticompetitive behavior in terms of assessments of large scale, in particular m&a, meaning that would impact future business development for the industry.
so, -- so, that's the first question. and then the second question, rather more positive. in terms of the jak, when i look at consensus, the forecasts for rinvoq are about $6 billion. when you look at the size of the opportunity in ra alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, uc, and the other indications you have.
is it conceivable to you short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market that -- that $6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimates for what this drug could do.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
andrew, this is -- this is rick. i mean, i'll obviously comment maybe on your point of view around the antitrust discussions. you know, clearly, i have accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the committee on may 18. you know, we certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident and the way we operate in this market as a highly competitive market where humira competes.
and certainly, as we look at the patents that were issued for humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. they represent true innovation to the product. they were challenged by competitors just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don't believe it's valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged, and the vast majority of those patents survived that challenge. and what i'd say is when we look at our behavior in this market, i think our -- our behavior was absolutely pro-competitive.
we had patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio. and yet, we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. so, i feel highly confident in the position that -- that we have taken in this marketplace, that we have operated totally appropriately. and then on your next question on rinvoq, i'm sorry, i was thinking about the first one.
so, can you repeat your question?
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
i -- i will. i mean, i -- you -- just finishing on the first. so, you referenced your future test to be -- and i guess it was more general love than just abbvie-centric, how it would impact bd, and the ability to -- the ability of the industry to operate if pricing can't get resolved. but moving on to the second question.
so, my question was whether consensus forecast for rinvoq look unrealistically conservative given the scale of the opportunities and given in ra alone, looking at the size of that market, it's a progressive disease that you don't actually need atopic dermatitis to get in excess of where consensus currently takes forecasts, which are when we look, about $6 billion.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andrew, this is rob. i'll start and then i'll hand it over to jeff. i think we agree with you. we do think consensus is conservative.
we've given the 2025 guidance of $8 billion for and we would expect it to grow beyond to 2025. when i look at the current consensus, obviously as you quoted, it's a little bit -- just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers i'm looking at. and i look at the growth beyond '25, it's nowhere near what we're expecting. so, we feel very good about the opportunity there.
i think what we've covered with you in december still holds as we've broken out the contribution by indication. we still feel very good about that, but we would agree that the consensus is very conservative right now.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. thanks, rob. this is jeff, and agree, it's -- these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic markets. so, we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market, we see the ibd market which with both assets we think is under-appreciated.
i mean, even expansions in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy. and so, we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. and just a comment on atopic derm, this is -- this is an explosive market. i mean, it is -- it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of -- in terms of the penetration, though it's going to grow substantially.
and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business, you know, the growth of the second line, that's not to say that we're not going to be very competitive in the frontline. it's a very, very attractive space. and again, i think the -- the performance that we've seen -- in the clinical performance that we've seen right now primarily on the induction trials for skyrizi and rinvoq. skyrizi in crohn's, rinvoq in uc is very, very encouraging.
and so, we see that cascading over our long-range plans as well. so, we are very, very bullish. agree that consensus is conservative.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, andrew. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. our next question comes from vamil divan with mizuho securities. your line is open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks so much for taking my questions. and i got a couple if i could on the migraine inside. so, first on ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well in -- in gaining share.
it also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you've been gaining a little share within the class relative to neurotech. so, i'm just wondering if you can sort of share your perspective on what you're seeing is driving that. some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access, but based on our calculation, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the biohaven side. so, any perspective would be helpful.
and then on atogepant maybe just a little more if you could talk to your go-to-market strategy assuming approval in september, especially again given neurotech will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. so, how do you see, you know, kind of coming in with two separate drugs, you know, could be two copays to -- it's just a difference or a message relative to what you're seeing your drugs are. just any perspective on how, you know, could be with that would be helpful as well. thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
ok. perfect. it's -- it's jeff and -- and in terms of the acute market, as i mentioned, the -- the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely as i highlighted. if you look at the mix between ubrelvy and neurotech, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks.
but it's -- it's very close. i mean, we typically run it 51%, 52%, 53% of the new-prescription basis. i think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that's taking place there and i clearly don't have full insight into the biohaven fall-through. but we've been quite disciplined.
you know, we have over 90% commercial access, so we're quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective. and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning, but also the right type of profitability over time. so, we're encouraged with our continued momentum with ubrelvy. in terms of atogepant, i think what's quite -- quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have.
and i think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral. so, we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset. and we think that, frankly, you need to take care of the migraine and atogepant will be very well-positioned to do that. we also think that we'll have nice synergies.
obviously, we have a fairly significant salesforce that is promoting ubrelvy to both the neurologists and the high-prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put atogepant into that sales suite. so, we're set up well we think for our go-to-market.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, vamil. thanks, vamil. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from tim anderson with wolfe research. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions, please. i haven't heard really any drug company this reporting season talk about future potential austerity measures in ex-u.s. geographies.
meaning, you know, broad-based price cuts following from the impact of covid. so, as a company, as one of the few companies that's given detailed long-term financial guidance, i'm guessing you have been thinking about this and i'm wondering how you are currently viewing this in terms of its likelihood of occurring and what the magnitude could be and what the timing might be. and then the second question is just on early stage pipeline asset. your tnf steroid antibody-drug conjugate, i believe you have in-house probably a fair amount of data that the markets haven't seen yet.
i'm wondering when we might see additional human data and what your current level of enthusiasm is toward that platform.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so, tim, this is rick. i'll cover the -- ex-u.s. austerity measures. i mean, certainly, if we go back to 2008, we saw that kind of an impact.
so, as we were building out our long-range plan, we have made some sets of assumptions around that. i would expect that we will see some pressure outside the u.s. going forward over the next couple of years. it's certainly manageable within the -- within the expectations that we have built for the business going forward.
certainly, based on that level of experience that we've seen historically, it's manageable. so, it is something that we have contemplated, and i would frankly expect to see some level of pressure going forward.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike, i'll take the second question. with respect to the tnf steroid conjugate program, we're obviously advancing abbv-154. we have a large phase 2b ra study that will start this quarter, and then we're starting studies in additional immune-mediated conditions as well over the course of the year. with respect to publication of the -- of the data from 3373, which is the closely related compound from the same platform that we top-line results some time ago, i think you can expect to see more detailed data over the course of the summer.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, tim. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve scala with cowen. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
many thanks. first, on rinvoq. i'm curious what additional safety data has fda been provided that it did not have previously, and has all of it been previously presented? and if not, what was the conclusion of what now has been submitted? so that's the first question. and secondly, regarding imbruvica, to what extent can abbvie tease out covid impact on new patient starts versus competition from new frontline agents? thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so, this is mike. i'll take the first question and then rick will handle the second. with respect to rinvoq, the additional safety data that we presented to the fda or provided to the fda are essentially a roll-forward of the analysis that we did at the time of the nda submission. obviously, our database continues to grow, we accumulate patient years' experience.
and so, there weren't fundamentally new analyses, but we did an updated assessment with the additional data that have accrued in the time between submission and when we submitted those responses. and what i would say is the data that we reviewed have not changed our impression of benefit-risk in any way. i think they're very consistent with all of the data that have been publicly presented. obviously, since they represent data that were current up to the time that we submitted just a few weeks ago, not all of these data have been presented in the public domain.
but i would say that our response is very consistent with what we have described publicly in the past.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and then your -- on your second question, this is rick. we get data on new patient starts. so, we have relatively, i think, accurate data. it's offset by a couple of months.
i'll have jeff maybe talk about it a little more in detail. so, we know any cll patient when they start regardless of therapy, we can measure that. and obviously, we can measure again what type of therapy they start on. so, i think the level of data integrity that we operate with -- from a market standpoint here is pretty good.
it's offset by a few months and maybe jeff speaks to the time offset that -- that it has.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. so, steve, it's jeff. so, it -- we can -- we have pretty good visibility to what -- what's happening from the share perspective versus the market-start perspective. i'll give you some flavor.
with regard to calquence, you know, we can -- we can see the impact of the approvals in the front and second-line cll, and it's largely consistent with what our expectations were. so, they're ramping in a similar fashion to what we saw in the mcl or nhl. so, we know that there's some impact on an -- on imbruvica there. the largest impact has been unfortunately into the market and unfortunately, i mean, for the patients.
so, i'll give you a little bit of the numbers. so, typically, the cll market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level like 2% every year. if you look at the impact from covid, we can see almost three different ways. we can see a wave where the new patient starts in the market were down in the high teens in the first part, ok? then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down and then it got hit again into the -- into the teens in the august period, and we saw it down again in early january about 18%.
so, we can see what's happening, and as i mentioned in my remark -- remarks, the biggest -- the biggest impact here has been on continued market suppression due to covid.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and, steve, this is rob. i would just remind you also in the first quarter that we had the stocking impact from covid last year. so, if you -- if you adjust for that's about a four-point impact on imbruvica's growth year over year due to the prior-year comp with the stocking impact.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. thank you. our next question comes from david risinger with morgan stanley. your line is open.
david risinger -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes. thanks very much and congrats on the -- on the results and updates. i have two questions. first, just to follow on on that comment, could you just help us understand a little bit more about why imbruvica is such an outlier in the cancer market? why the pandemic is hitting imbruvica very hard, whereas the pandemic is not hitting other cancer agents so hard? and then second, with respect to aesthetics, it's obviously booming and it is validating your acquisition of allergan.
but i think that you updated guidance for the year for botox cosmetic to $1.9 billion and that implies flat sequential sales from the $477 million that you booked in the first quarter. so, if you could explain that, please. thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so, this is mike. i'll -- i'll take the first question and then others will comment on -- on your second question. with respect to why imbruvica is being hit harder than other anticancer agents in the pandemic, i think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression of cll. so, cll, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term, there's a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example.
certainly, much slower than aml, another indication that we are very active in the -- in the hemonc space. and so, i think in the -- in the setting of the pandemic, that's why you are seeing more deferrals for start of therapy and -- and in some cases, longer time to switch of therapy which would explain why imbruvica dynamics are different than other anticancer agents that treat other diseases.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and, david, this is rob. on your question regarding botox cosmetic, so we did see in the first quarter, if you just look at toxins market growth, it's over 30% in the first quarter. there is some impact from pent-up demand as you come out of the pandemic. but we feel very good about the long -- the forecast we put forward.
we actually took it up $100 million to essentially pass through to be in the quarter. i'd say your math on flat sequential, i think it's up a little bit. but really if you consider that we did have some level of pent-up demand come through in the quarter, you got to back that out to understand the underlying demand dynamics.
david risinger -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, david. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. the next question comes from ronny gal with bernstein. your line is open.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hi, everybody. congratulations on a very nice quarter and thank you for fitting me in. two questions if i may. first, there was a data presented from richter about negative symptoms improvement using vraylar.
i was wondering, what is your take on the data in terms of your ability to use it in the united states? is it something you are considering doing a trial on, could this potentially be added to the label, and so forth? and second, i wasn't -- the -- the growth in botox neurology is really impressive. it seems relatively odd that there is such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in january forward for a -- a physician-administered product. can you just give us a flavor of what the underlying trends there.? there are just a lot more success that you're having in pushing first patients who failed azathioprine to -- into botox. how should we think about this?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so, this is mike. i'll take the first question and then others are coming on your second question. with respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it's a very challenging area, it's a very important area because they're responsible for much of the -- the long-term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. it has been a very difficult area to approach in general, and we believe vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact in the disease.
but it's also one that's been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the u.s. it's been a very difficult claim to get in the u.s. so it's not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label. but i do think the overall profile of vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit-risk are viewed, you know, very positively by treating physicians.
and i think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians. and i think that is reflected in vraylar's overall strong performance. 
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
ron, it's jeff. and with regard to botox, it's insightful because we are seeing some robust activity, particularly in migraine. and i think there's a couple of reasons for that. you know, one, rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in china.
we've definitely focused our sales team, you know, on the -- on the migraine component. and the other thing that's taken place is a little bit, i think, of an investment approach. we have more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously, the legacy allergan. so i think the combination of the consumer investment, new ways where if patients access a injector or neurologist, they can get a sample of botox right at their first -- first appointment rather than wait for many months.
there are various commercial reasons we think that give us a lot of encouragement on the therapeutic botox performance, again, specifically and particularly in migraine.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ronny. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from terence flynn with goldman sachs. your line is open. 
terence flynn -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. maybe two for me. i recognize there's still a lot of unknowns here, but how are you thinking about the potential headwind from any changes to corporate tax rates and -- and gilti? and then given the progress you outlined on debt paydown, you'll be back to about a two times leverage ratio you mentioned.
how are you thinking about capital allocation into the end of this year and into 2022? what types of assets are you focused on for bd and m&a? thank you. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so, this is rick. i'll cover the tax. i mean, as you said, it's certainly early in the process, and we, obviously, know what's being proposed, but we don't necessarily know where we will end up. i think one of the important things that -- that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to -- one, you know, one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happen: one, that u.s.-based companies were competitive for their foreign competitors; and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the united states.
and i can certainly talk about the abbvie example. i mean, i think it's pretty compelling when you sit back and look at, you know, we were able to go out and acquire an irish company, redomicile it back to the united states. you know, abbvie today has 24,000 jobs in the united states. we've also increased investments significantly in the u.s.
since tax reform -- you know, in the last three years, we've invested $1.5 billion. we committed that we'd do $2.5 billion over time, and we exceed that commitment. we added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. so companies like ours, it clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive.
and certainly, in the acquisition of a company like allergan, i think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the u.s. so i think going forward, one of the things that's important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don't go back to where we were, and that is where u.s. companies aren't as competitive against their foreign competitors. the current proposal would make the u.s.
have the highest rate of all developed countries. i'm not sure that's the position you'd want to be in. so hopefully, as we go forward, there'll be a balance that's looked at in raising taxes. but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the u.s. 
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
terence, this is rob. on your question regarding capital allocation. i'll start, and then mike will add more color in terms of bd. we've said all along is we continue -- we will continue to delever through 2023.
so, you know, think about net leverage ratio getting to two times in '22. i think our balance sheet would be in very good shape, but we want to continue to pay down the debt through '23. during that period, we've allocated $2 billion of capital for business development. you've seen us do some very nice deals, whether you look at genmab, i-mab.
we've done a number of nice transactions in the space with that amount of capital, but i'll let mike speak to future opportunities, as well.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
in terms of areas in which we would expect to be active between now and the end of 2022, we'll continue to be active in oncology, both in hematological oncology and in solid tumors. that has been an area of focus for us, and i see that continuing as an area of focus. we would certainly like to add to the aesthetics franchise. we've talked about how we will invest and continue to drive that franchise and from a business development perspective.
i think there are a number of opportunities there that could present themselves in that time frame. and there are other areas that opportunistically we would certainly like to add to. i would point to neuroscience if we could find the right opportunities. and eye care as additional areas, where we could be investing. 
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, terence. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. our next question comes from daniel busby with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
daniel busby -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning. i'd like to ask a follow-up on aesthetics in your high single-digit annual growth target for that business over the next decade. broadly speaking, how much of that growth is dependent on bringing new products to market, such as long and short-acting toxins versus driving continued growth from the aesthetics portfolio that you have today? and second, as we near the one-year anniversary of your acquisition of allergan, can you provide updated thoughts on your appetite for potential divestitures of non-core products or therapeutic areas now that you've had about a year to digest that transaction? thank you. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. i'll cover that and maybe rob can -- can tag team along here. i mean if you look at our overall estimate of high single-digit growth on aesthetics, it's not heavily reliant on a -- on a large number of new products. there will be new products that come in.
they're probably closer toward the back end of the long-range plan. so they don't have a -- they don't have a significant impact on that overall growth rate. so i think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market. if we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher. 
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, this is rob. i would just add that if you look at the aesthetics business, i mean, we'll see significant growth, not just from toxins and fillers, but also in body contouring. so as we think about the potential for that leg of the stool, you know, we think we've got really three key drivers of growth within aesthetics that will help us get to that high single-digit, long-term expectation. and again, as rick mentioned, we're not counting on significant contribution on the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation, particularly with the toxins and fillers.
and of course, as you've heard before, it's important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well. so we feel very good about that outlook and we're not counting on a ton from the pipeline there.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and then your second question, i would say, you know, even before the allergan acquisition, we constantly looked at our portfolio and -- and determine whether or not there were areas of our business that we ultimately thought. we were interested in divesting. i'd say that -- that's a process that we go through on a fairly consistent basis to ensure that we're maximizing the value of the assets that we have within our portfolio. and so, you know, we will continue to do that.
and when we find opportunities where we think that's the right strategy, then we'll execute against that strategy. 
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, daniel. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. our next question comes from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. a couple more for me on rinvoq. are you hearing anecdotally any physicians that may be switching patients from xeljanz to rinvoq in ra if there's a perceived safety benefit with rinvoq as a more selective jak? are you able to take advantage of that at all? and then secondly, if rinvoq gets approved for atopic derm, how will you look to build out your presence with dermatologists? will you leverage your current footprint on the aesthetics side? or will you have a completely different medical derm team? so just talk about how you go after that opportunity and how you're preparing for it given your clear level of excitement there? thank you. 
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah, hi. it's jeff, and i'll take both of those. so we are -- we're actually not hearing physicians, you know, from our intelligence, from our field teams actively thinking to switch patients from xeljanz to rinvoq. i mean that's a -- that's a big decision for a physician.
what we -- what we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a xeljanz issue. so, typically, what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts. but we don't -- we don't see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching. so that's basically our intelligence on your first question.
in terms of your second question, we will not be using the aesthetic sales force. we will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we've taken place for rinvoq and atopic dermatitis. i think, as you know, that in terms of our reputation among the medical derms is extremely strong. we have the no.
1 reputation because of the years of humira in psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis, and hs. and obviously, we have a very, very strong impression and launch from skyrizi. so we basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade. and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building -- we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists.
an important fact is that basically, the overlap of those dermatologists that drives basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market. so we feel we're well-positioned in terms of how we set up our go-to-market approach with this segment. 
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, gary. operator, next question, please.
operator
yes. our next question comes from gregg gilbert with truist securities. your line is open.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. mike, i was interested in your oral psoriasis commentary. are you assuming that a new bar has been set by deucravacitinib in terms of efficacy versus otezla? and is that something you're very mindful of as you consider your own programs? and secondly, for rick, i realize abbvie was born out of a company that had devices and pharma under one roof. but clearly, you've embraced in aesthetics, for example, that good franchise-building could involve drugs and devices or drugs that need to be delivered by device.
does that apply, as you think ahead about ophthalmology or other areas when you consider long-term bd? thank you. 
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so, this is mike. i'll take the first question. with respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that -- that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with otezla. and i think coming in, in a range that is humira-like or better would be our goal.
i think if you look at, you know, bms's tyk2, they sort of come in, you know, at that humira-like efficacy. and so i think that is generally the range that we're talking about. i think when one talks about, you know, a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy, but it's safety and it's the totality of the data. obviously, it's extremely early for -- for our ror gamma t agent, but we think it is a molecule because it impacts very well understood biology, with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety that we can get in a range that's very competitive there.
so i think we'd be looking for that humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space within oral, obviously, coupled with a strong safety profile.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
on your second question, this is rick. i mean, i think the way we approach the markets that we operate in, as we look for areas where there are significant unmet need, and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. sometimes it's drug only, in fact, i'd say, the majority of our historical experience as abbvie has been it was a drug only. but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it's a combination product, right, a device, and a drug.
certainly, as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options that are available for physicians and patients. so i'd say we tend to go at it, and we're certainly not opposed to devices being part of it. if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in standard of care. in aesthetics, as rob indicated a moment ago, you know, we're looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body.
and i would say, in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role. and so that's an area where i think you'll see us embrace even device-only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. so it's an area that we, historically, many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life. but i'd say also the teams and the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, gregg. operator, we have time for one final question. 
operator
thank you. our last question comes from navin jacob with ubs. your line is open.
navin jacob -- ubs
hi, thanks so much for squeezing me in here. a couple, if i may, if we have time. but just on vraylar, you have the strong long-term guidance of $4 billion with just the existing indications. but the script trends, at least, seem to have slowed down, obviously, in part because neuro has been weak as an overall therapeutic area during the pandemic.
but just wondering -- and just given that the quarter itself was a little bit weaker, i think, versus expectations, can you talk about the broader neuro market is that weakness there because we do see strength with ubrelvy and with botox therapeutics? so just wondering if there's something going on specifically with vraylar? has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason? and what can you -- what do you -- what can you admit to do to accelerate growth for vraylar with the existing indications? that's number one. and number two, on rinvoq, i think everyone understands the rates around dvt/pe and mace. but if you could give a little bit more clarity on -- based on the updated data that you filed with the agency, what the rate of malignancy is across the indications, and whether that's any different between the strengths and how that compares to the background rate. thank you so much. 
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah, hi, it's jeff. i'll take the vraylar comment. you know, the macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends. but we really think it's simply a timing issue, and i'll give you some numbers that support that.
so before covid hit right in the first quarter of last year, the new-to-brand or the nbrx for vraylar was about 3,500 new-to-brand prescriptions a week. and what we saw is during covid, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700. that was the midyear. and then it's consistently come back up.
so toward the end of march, we've started to hit or recover that pre-covid historical rate. so progress is there. and ultimately, the way we see these markets functions, as you recover your nbrx momentum, the trxs will start to come. so we're encouraged on the latest trends, but your point is right.
it has been a little bit soft on the market. and certainly, as a brand, vraylar dropped because of covid but is now really fully recovered. and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. so hopefully, that helps.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so, this is mike. i'll take your second question. with respect to the rates of malignancies, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer because that's the way these rates are typically reviewed. i recently described a rate across rinvoq studies with roughly 10,000 patient-years experience of 0.8 events per 100 patient-years experience.
and that compared to an expected rate that was 0.9 or higher, depending on the estimates. so we'll call it in the range of about 0.9 events. so not different from that expected rate and without any difference between doses, so no evidence of a dose response. and nothing that we've seen in the recent work that we've done changes that -- that view in any way. 
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
you may begin. 
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; rob michael, executive vice president and chief financial officer; and jeff stewart, executive vice president, commercial operations. joining us for the q&a portion of the call is laura schumacher, vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary. before we get started, i remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of zenpep and viokace. references to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange.
following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our first-quarter performance and outlook. and then jeff, mike, and rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress, and financial results in more detail.
we're off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom-line first-quarter performance. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. total adjusted net revenues of $12.9 billion, was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. these results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and aesthetics, as well as high single-digit operational growth from hematological oncology.
additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. skyrizi and rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. imbruvica and venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in cll and other hematological malignancies. vraylar, which remains one of the fastest-growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth.
ubrelvy, the leading oral cgrp for acute migraines, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis. and within our leading aesthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-covid levels, botox cosmetics and juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. both of these -- both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. the integration of allergan also continues to go very well.
as illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. while the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. we see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in march. although certain markets continue to remain below pre-covid levels, including cll and hcv, in particular.
we expect the increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a full recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. based on a robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full-year 2021 eps guidance, and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. i'm also extremely pleased with our r&d prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, especially within our late-stage pipeline. we're on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021.
this includes atogepant, a novel oral cgrp for episodic migraines, adding to our already attractive migration portfolio. a new eyedrop for the treatment of presbyopia. as well as expanded indications for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis. and we expect more than a half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including navitoclax for myelofibrosis, abbv-951 for advanced parkinson's disease, skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and crohn's disease, rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for imbruvica and venclexta.
with these collectively growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long-term outlook -- our long-term outlook remains very strong. in closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution, as well as pipeline advancement. i'm pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. we're off to another excellent start in 2021.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. we demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the u.s., offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter.
our new immunology agents, skyrizi and rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. this is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. skyrizi total prescriptions share in the u.s.
psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to humira. additionally, we recently received approval for a single-dose pre-filled pen for skyrizi, which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. skyrizi is now the only quarterly dosed psoriasis treatment available in an auto-injector, further improving the patient experience. rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the u.s.
ra market. physician and patient feedback remain very positive on rinvoq's level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit-risk profile. internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share. skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the eu5 psoriasis markets, exceeding tremfya and cosentyx, and at parity with taltz.
as mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of skyrizi and rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. in hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including cll, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within cll where the market remains below pre-covid levels.
imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the covid-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis, with increasing share in frontline cll and continued strong performance in aml. in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. vraylar once again delivered strong growth.
sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the u.s. atypical antipsychotic market. within migraines, the launch of ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting ubrelvy's efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access.
ubrelvy is the no. 1 branded acute treatment for migraines based on both new patient share and prescription growth. the oral cgrp therapies, including our leading ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. we believe there is substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand.
we also look forward to the expected commercial approval of atogepant, our oral cgrp for episodic migraine, later this year. botox therapeutic, you're seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine, as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. mavyret sales were $415 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-covid levels.
and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the u.s. for the treatment of adults with ibs-c or chronic idiopathic constipation. overall, i'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we're making with recent new product launches. we remain on track to deliver a very strong revenue growth in 2021.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d progress. mike? 
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology where we continue to make good progress with rinvoq and skyrizi in new disease areas, as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. we recently reported positive top-line results from the second induction study for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. similar to results from the first induction study, in this phase 3 trial, rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement.
the 45-milligram induction dose was well-tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previous rinvoq studies. in these induction trials, we saw no dvt, pe, mace events, or malignancies in the rinvoq groups. and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. we believe these induction data compare very favorably to other uc treatments on the market or in development.
and based on the data generated to date, rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. we expect to see results from the uc maintenance study this summer, with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. the rinvoq program in crohn's disease is also progressing very well, and we expect to see induction data from the first of two phase 3 trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second phase 3 trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. we're also nearing completion of our pivotal program for skyrizi in crohn's disease.
earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two crohn's induction studies, and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. our regulatory submissions for skyrizi in crohn's disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. following completion of our registrational program for skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the u.s. and europe, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022.
we're very pleased with the level of activity we saw with skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our phase 3 program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. our regulatory submissions are currently under review for rinvoq in three new indications in the u.s., ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. as we previously announced, the fda recently extended the review periods for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for rinvoq in these indications. in response to the fda request, we provided updated data from across rinvoq programs in ra, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis.
based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in june and for atopic dermatitis in july. the regulatory action date for rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for june. we remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of rinvoq across all indications and we'll work with the fda to bring rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. earlier this year, we received european approval for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and as.
our european regulatory application for rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a chmp opinion this summer, with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. we also recently saw results from a four-week phase 1b study, evaluating our novel small molecule, ror gamma t, inverse agonist abbv-157 in patients with psoriasis. by targeting ror gamma t with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit il-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. in our phase 1b study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent, and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger phase 2b dose-ranging study in the second half of this year.
moving now to our oncology portfolio. we continue to make very good progress with our late-stage programs for imbruvica, venclexta, and venetoclax, as well as with our early stage oncology assets. we remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations, and phase transitions this year. at the upcoming asco and eha meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the imbruvica plus venclexta captivate trial fixed-duration cohort in treatment-naive cll patients.
the imbruvica-venclexta combination is an important element of our hemo strategy to provide a differentiated fixed-duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. data from our imbruvica-venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline cll later this year. we will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from venclexta's cll14 trial in frontline cll, as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a phase 1b study evaluating venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-naive high-risk mds patients. we expect this mds study to complete in the second half of this year.
and if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek accelerated approval. in the area of solid tumors, at the recent aacr meeting, we presented phase 2 results for teliso-v in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. in this study, teliso-v demonstrated a promising response rate in heavily pre-treated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed c-met where we saw a 54% objective response rate. c-met is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer where approximately 30% of patients have to overexpress c-met.
approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors, an anti-c-met antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. in contrast, our c-met antibody-drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. we recently began the second stage of our phase 2 study, which has the potential to support accelerated approval in second-line plus metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. we also plan to evaluate teliso-v in the frontline setting including in combination with other agents as well as in other c-met positive tumor types.
we also have a next-generation c-met adc program that will be entering the clinic later this year. our new c-met adc, abbv-400, utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified met and overexpressed c-met subtypes. thus, providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti-c-met targeting agents. in neuroscience.
we recently presented data from several key programs at the american academy of neurology annual meeting. a total of 33 abstracts were presented including data from the phase 3 advanced study in episodic migraines prevention, showing that atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective safe and well-tolerated all treatment option with a rapid onset of action. the fda recently accepted our nda for atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraines and an approval decision is expected in september of this year. we also presented results from an open-label phase 3 study evaluating ubrelvy in pre-menstrual migraines, which showed that ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment for migraine attacks that occurred during or near menstruation.
menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe, and often resistant to treatment. and we presented data from a phase 1 study demonstrating that abbv-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent libido exposure to do over in advanced parkinson's patients. results from the pivotal program for abbv-951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. we also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two phase 3 studies for vraylar in adjunctive major depressive disorder.
and if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. in eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the u.s. for agn-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses.
this new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. an approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. and in aesthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next-generation toxins and filler programs. by combining the aesthetic team's deep expertise with abbvie's breadth and scale of resources, we'll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster.
looking across our portfolio, we've identified a number of programs to accelerate including our short-acting and long-acting toxins as well as our next-generation biostimulatory triple elastin and collagen and fillers. acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long-term growth for the aesthetics franchise. so in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our first-quarter performance and financial outlook.
rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. starting with first-quarter results. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to the prior year and above our guidance midpoint. total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange.
the adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. this includes an adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense of 21.2% and sales. net interest expense was $622 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. as rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.1% at the midpoint.
excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible memorization and specified items. this guidance now contemplates full-year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. at current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. this implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion.
included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions. we now expect international humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. and we now expect botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. all other full-year assumptions remain unchanged.
as we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. finally, we continue to make great progress on our allergan transaction commitments.
we realize over $360 million expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. we have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. we continue to expect cumulative debt pay down of $17 billion by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. this will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022.
in closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. operator, first question, please.
",2021-Q1,ABBV
0.9996,1.0,,,":
operator
our first question is from vamil divan with mizuho securities. your line is now open, sir.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thanks very much for taking my question. so maybe 2, if i could. so one, rick, you mentioned you have several of the allergan products maybe doing better than your expectations.
can you maybe -- i mean, i know you want to sort of share your secret sauce, but in terms of what is it that you've noticed that has helped to drive those products? because it seems like it's pretty much across the board from aesthetics to vraylar, ubrelvy. so is it around promotion efforts? is it around sort of payer dynamics? what -- anything you could share would be helpful there. and then the second one on imbruvica. i just want to confirm, i think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%.
so i just want to see you guys are in line with when you expect at this point. obviously, there's been questions around some of the competitors that have entered the market. and maybe you can just talk about the patients who are not studying on imbruvica? sort of what are you seeing as the reasons why they might be choosing a competitor. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. vamil, this is rick. i'll cover a certain part of the first question, and maybe i'll ask jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that you might have. i think as you look at this business, one of the things that i think abbvie is sort of known for is that we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way especially across what we consider to be growth range.
we expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic and long-term basis but also from a short-term tactical basis. and i'll use aesthetics as the example. early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention they needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. we did that globally.
so if you look at allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eye care and other therapeutic products. so we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of abbvie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. and then in the u.s., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated r&d organization that's totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and it reports directly to mike. and then the head of the business for aesthetics reports directly to me.
and we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. so i think it's really 3 aspects of it from my perspective. it's one, the structure we put in place, and that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. two, it's the disciplined processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses.
and then third, i'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. and certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in sg&a and we've increased the investment in r&d. jeff, anything you'd add?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
i think, rick, the -- i would agree. i think a big piece is the level of the investment. so as we looked at the -- particularly the neuroscience compounds, vraylar and ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. so i think that all of these brands are spectacular brands, leadership position.
and when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response. so nothing to add beyond that. going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that i referred to was the combined abbvie share. so that's imbruvica plus venclexta across all lines of cll.
so if you take a look -- if i give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total abbvie share, which is made up around 24% for imbruvica and 11% for venclexta. for second-line share, for example, we have a 48% total abbvie position, which is approximately 33% for imbruvica and 15% for venclexta. so both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across cll. i'll give you some more thoughts as you asked for in terms of color in the market.
beyond that leadership level that we have across the cll indication, we do see that the cll market is still suppressed. so for example, patient starts year to date are down in the high single digits. and even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. we see that improving.
and so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. in terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to calquence within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their cll ramp. but also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy cd20, which we think is also a covid type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. so overall, the franchise is performing very, very well.
and as you heard from mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises than before.
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and vamil, this is rob. i'm going to come back to your first question. just one more thing we should mention is we've been able to really leverage our international infrastructure. and so we set up this business.
we have the aesthetics franchise focused fully internationally on that business, whereas allergan had combined with therapeutics. so we've been able to bring that focus in the level of investment. i think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. so we're very strong across the globe.
and so when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, i think international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the allergan business.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, vamil. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you for your question. our next question is from chris schott with j.p. morgan. you may ask your question.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much. just another one on aesthetics. obviously, some incredibly strong numbers here.
can you just elaborate a little bit more on sustainability of this growth? so i guess i'm just trying to get a better sense of how much of what we're seeing right now is catch up as we exit lockdowns versus a more sustained step-up in sales going forward? just any color on that would be appreciated. my second question was rinvoq in uc. can you just help put some of this data into context as you think about the competitive landscape and particularly relative to what you had anticipated in your long-term guidance for this indication? i think you had about $1 billion in ibd sales by 2025. and if not, we've seen more of this data set.
just how comfortable are you feeling with that target and ultimately, the role rinvoq is going to play in this space. thanks so much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hey, chris. this is rick. i'll take the aesthetics question, and then mike and maybe cover the second question to add. so it's a great question, and it's one that we have been looking at very carefully.
i mean if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to try to drive the business. we believe this business is significantly underpenetrated. when you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration, it's tremendous. and so that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand.
globally, the aesthetics sales were up 31%. if you look at the u.s. toxin and filler business, the market is up about 40% versus 2019. so -- but it's hard to evaluate.
i can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand, and we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. but we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was covid related. and we look at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint and are now back at work. i'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you would draw from that is very little of it is covid related.
now i think the flaw is this. most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. so i think to the best of our ability, what i would tell you is about two-thirds of the performance, i think, is fundamental demand and maybe one-third of it is pent-up demand. we're going to need a couple more quarters, i think, to see how that plays out.
but i'd say that's our best assessment right now. so very robust growth either way but -- and it could sustain a little bit better than that. but i think you can pretty well count on two-thirds of it being fundamental demand that's sustainable longer term. mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
i'll take the question on rinvoq uc. what i would say is the data that we have seen from rinvoq uc has exceeded our expectations from an efficacy perspective. and the results there are very strong. uc has been very difficult to pharmacologically and getting high rates of remission and response has been challenging and both has delivered those results now across a number of studies.
and i think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. i commented in my prepared remarks the fact that overall rates of aes, serious aes are actually lower than now the reason for that, that many of these are driven by and with an improvement in the disease, you do see them improve as well. and with respect to events and interest, the safety profile has looked very, very well and other interest rates have been comparable to controls. and so overall, we feel very confident in that.
we just feel very confident a long-term guidance that we put out. one thing that's important to keep in mind is that long-term guidance is 2025 guidance. and our ibd assets will be in relatively early stages of launch by 2025. but the profiles that i've talked about, not only for rinvoq but also for skyrizi bode well not only for that 2025 guidance but for the long-term growth of a significant opportunity there as well.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question will be from ronny gal with bernstein. you may ask your question, sir.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking the question. first one is on abbv-951. you've mentioned the efficacy rates. i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the skin safety profile as compared to the neuroderm product or the apomorphine iv from europe, especially when it comes to some more severe effects like abscess.
the second question is staying with the pipeline is a little bit about your a beta. it didn't take long for you guys to walk into that. i was kind of wondering if you can talk a little bit about the science that you're discovering. is the right approach to get to the best effect with minimal side effects to try to remove as much plaque as possible in a very targeted manner? or should the approach be to go after soluble abrogate and approach the removal of plaque indirectly.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
ok. so this is mike. i'll take both of those questions. with respect to 951, we'll publish full data from the phase 3 study that i described at a medical meeting and then ultimately in peer-reviewed journals as well.
but what i can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations, well within our expectations. as one would expect with the cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. we've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin. we feel good about the safety profile.
and we think the patient-friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump-like device will be a real advantage here because it allow patients to get that duopa-like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's and very, very difficult to manage. and so we feel very good about the potential for 951. with respect to a beta, i think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit. and the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in the level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe, until you get to that amyloid negativity level by pet, which is -- until you reduce patients at that level.
so the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible and to do that while minimizing the impacted area. and we think that, that can be done through epitope selection. there are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. and with appropriate epitope selection, we believe and our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area.
and of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data support that as well. but those are the basic principles that we're following. we've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval because, as i said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. but we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science i described plays out in the clinic.
but our approaches with respect to a beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, ronny. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from andrew baum with citi. you may ask your question.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks. a couple of questions for jeff. firstly, on the outlook for rebating and oncology. this is somewhat of a novelty at least historically.
i note that esi excluded calquence from their formulary. there's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. how should we be thinking about the rebating outlook in oncology going forward more broadly? second, on the u.s. payer mix through covid and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the medicaid component and the patient assistance programs or whether you're seeing that improvement or some sense of scale and direction there?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you, andrew. and to start with oncology, i mean, largely, as you know, the rebating has been done through the sort of the gpo channel. and particularly with the physician in-office dynamics that are in that sector.
we don't see significant rebating happening at the pbm level. and if it is, it's quite modest. i think the -- certainly, from the esi standpoint that you highlighted, that was an esi decision. that was not certainly something that abbvie approach the -- that particular payer with any sort of deal.
our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. so i think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on, but they've been quite modest. and i don't think that they're going to be super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. that's my position on that.
i think the second approach in terms of -- sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the medicaid. yes, this has been quite interesting. we've seen certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in medicaid has gone up. when we look across our businesses at, let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest.
they're there. so we don't see massive movements around our channel shifting that linked to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. so it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. and i think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned to come back and that could be quite strong, i think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
this is rick. the only thing i'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and i would say generous pap program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. and as an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients we approve. we actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands.
and so it's a program that i think is designed to fulfill the mission that i just described, and that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them whatever system that they operate in. and -- but we have not seen -- and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increase dramatically even through covid. and we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their job during covid that we would provide our medicines to them. but i wouldn't say -- as i said, much to our surprise, we didn't see the volume go up dramatically.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
many thanks.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, andrew. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoffrey porges with leerink. you may ask your question, sir.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you very much. lots of questions, but i'll focus first on rinvoq. rick, you've given the long-term guidance of, i recall, $7 billion in revenue by 2025, i think. and by all means, correct me if i don't recall correctly, but if you only get the 15-milligram dose approved, if that's the outcome of the deliberations of the fda but you get the approvals in europe, can you achieve that revenue guidance? are you confident enough in the 15-milligram program? and then secondly for mark, your cf development program seems to have been sort of reactivated.
and could you talk a little bit about your conviction a little bit more detail on 119? we don't know much about that. are you confident that it can be an active c2 corrector that matches up to your competition because clearly, that's a big revenue opportunity that we haven't factored in? thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
geoffrey, this is rick. on your first question, yes, the guidance for rinvoq is $8 billion, and i would say we're confident that even with the 15 milligram, we will sustain that guidance. if you look at the performance of the 15 milligram, it's quite remarkable. and so we feel good about the performance of rinvoq.
we continue to see strong uptake of rinvoq and physician interest and is consistent with what we would expect. so i think we're fine there.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take the question on the cf program. when we restructured the collaboration with galapagos a few years ago to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. one is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator and c1 components of the regimen.
we felt we had a best-in-class c1 in 22, 22, but we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand and we've done that. we also believe that we needed a c2 corrector that -- in that time period a few years ago did not exist. so we needed a c2 corrector that had the potential to be best-in-class. and so what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds.
119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. and based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best-in-class c2 corrector. and with the other components of our triple, we think we can deliver best-in-class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low ddis, etc. and so we are now in a proof-of-concept phase 2 study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will, in fact, bear out.
what i would say here is the preclinical assays are good. they're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in cf, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. but ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. by right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof-of-concept results for that triple.
we'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year. those will be data that will include impact on fev1 with the triple. and so that will tell us whether we can be best-in-class. and i agree, if we are best-in-class, i think it's a very significant opportunity, and we would progress it rapidly.
now, it's a proof-of-concept study. so if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. we're studying the highest dose of 119 to determine whether it can have that effect. we'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly.
and then we would, if successful, move into phase 3 development.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thanks, mike.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, geoff. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoff meacham with bank of america. your line is open, sir.
geoff meacham -- bbank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for the question. just had a few quick ones. another one on jak safety.
and mike, you mentioned you expect regulatory action in the next few months. maybe just give us some perspective on that. is there any data that you're still waiting on to submit? and is there still the potential for an advisory panel? and then the second one is on ubrelvy. maybe just give us some color on the new start dynamic.
what are the patients you're capturing? what share are you gaining from? and maybe just help us with kind of the -- what other wins do you have to make with respect to formulary access and share. thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
i'll take the first question and then jeff will take the second question on ubrelvy. so with respect to jak safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. that's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. it's not a specific action date like the pdufa dates that had been set in the past.
so we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. but the rate limiting factor as we understand it, is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. and i think once that is completed, we would be able to move forward with good speed with our review. but there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us.
we provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly, and the agency has not requested any additional data. so it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance it's gaining as we understand it. with respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. but what i would say is if they were planning on having an advisory committee, i would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion, and we would know that.
and there's no indication that, that is underway at this time.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
great. and i'll take the ubrelvy question. as i mentioned, we're very, very pleased with ubrelvy and really, our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. to give you some sense, it's quite remarkable.
i mean if you look at the total acute oral cgrp category, so that's us and the competitor, it's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. so again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are looking for the adoption of these particular agents even though you have to step through a triptan in some cases, two triptanes. so the market demand is very, very substantial. when we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the two agents are sort of splitting the acute indication.
some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from nurtec. but nonetheless, i think that's a small piece of the story. when we sort of peel out some of their preventative, new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. but i really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time, and we anticipate that we'll continue to lead that based on ubrelvy overall profile.
our overall access dynamics are quite good. so we really have roughly a 90% access. again, some of that access is -- demands a step through of triptan. but overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position.
and so basically, our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. so thank you.
geoff meacham -- bbank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, geoff. operator, next question please.
operator
our next question is from tim anderson with wolfe research. you may ask your question.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. it's well-known that abbvie rebates heavily on humira in the u.s. so in biosimilars launch, would you potentially have room to pull back on those rebates, which could basically be a meaningful offset to lost humira volumes? it seems like you could end up being in the billions of dollars that you could pull back in-house. and i realize there's a rinvoq and skyrizi dynamic to consider.
and related to that line of questioning, how does the prospect of interchangeability biosimilars impact your thinking on this front? if interchangeable generics are allowed or not allowed, how does that impact what you might do with those rebate dollars? and then second question, a quick one, just the range of outcomes for when imbruvica might face generics in the u.s.. is it in the realm of possibilities that abbvie enters into settlement agreements with legal challengers that could push out generic timing?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
tim, it's rick. so i'll cover the first two questions that you have there. i would say, let me start with interchangeability. we've outlined now over the last year or 2, i think, pretty specifically what we view the biosimilar impact in the u.s.
to be, and we are assuming that there will be two interchangeable biosimilars and that's in the thought process of the erosion models that we have described many, many times now. so we are assuming there will be interchangeability. we're certainly not in a position where we're going to talk about what we're going to do from the standpoint of rebates. we've always competed very effectively in these markets.
certainly, the focus for us going forward is the next-generation assets, skyrizi and rinvoq. and you can see those two assets this year will do $4.6 billion, so call it $5 billion. they're rapidly growing, and they're doing exactly what we had hoped they would do. they have higher levels of efficacy, and they are ramping dramatically.
and they will buffer the impact, biosimilar impact in the u.s. and so what i'd tell you is the strategy is going exactly the way we had hoped it would go. we'll fill out the range of indications on skyrizi and rinvoq and continue to drive those assets into the marketplace effectively. on imbruvica?
laura schumacher -- vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary
yes. hi. this is laura schumacher. our imbruvica composition of matter patent expires in may of 2028, assuming that we get the pediatric extension.
we do have later expiring ip covering methods of use, formulation, crystal forms and the like. our long-range plan currently assumes the loss of exclusivity in the u.s. in may of 2028 when the composition of matter patent expires. there is litigation ongoing with one remaining anda filer, and we're awaiting a decision on that.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, tim. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from matthew harrison with morgan stanley. you may ask your question.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. good morning. thanks for taking the question. just a follow-up question on cf for you.
i guess, first, two parts here. first, are you confident that you have a potentiator that's active and improved versus the galapagos compound? because i think we've seen a lot of issues with people trying to develop potentiators that are as good as kalydeco. and then second, i know you talked about fev1. have you looked at sweat chloride at all? obviously, you need a larger patient sample size to get a good directional view on fev1.
i'm wondering if you looked at smaller patient numbers on sweat chloride. thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take that. with respect to the potentiator, we are convinced that we have a potentiator that has activity. and we've changed the potentiator from some of those prior combinations that were pursued earlier on in the galapagos collaboration.
we think that, that potentiator, it has clear signs of activity. we think the c1 corrector is very good and probably best-in-class based on the data that we have seen that were generated earlier in the collaboration. we thought that the principal piece that was missing was that c2 and we think we have a good one. with respect to the endpoints, while it does take a larger sample size to look at fev1, we feel like fev1 is what really matters here.
that's what's going to translate into clinical benefit for patients. and so our proof-of-concept study will show us fev1, and that's the primary measure that we are going to use to determine whether to advance the triple or not.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, matthew. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from steve scala with cowen. your line is open, sir.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions. many of the questions so far suggest concerns around rinvoq. but i'm wondering if this could all turn in to be a positive.
so to what extent do you believe rinvoq prescribing might be being held back by competitor product concerns? so once those concerns are resolved and/or rinvoq emerges unscathed, if it does, rinvoq could even do better and we could be looking at a sharp acceleration in share gains and prescription trends in q4. so that's the first question. and secondly, on humira contract renewals that will be signed in coming months for 2022. what is the typical duration of those contracts? are they typically 12 months, 24 months, 36 months? if you can give us an idea of that, that would be helpful.
thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. it's a very good question and it's a question that we thought a lot about. let me give you some perspective on rinvoq. so if you look at our, let's say, our demand performance, i think i mentioned in my prepared remarks we've been very consistent about 15% in-play share in the large ra market, which is just under humira, which has grown a little bit over the covid times and since january to about 18%.
so we're very, very stable. and i do believe that there is some overhang on certain segments of prescribers that have, let's say, gone back a little bit to the tnf, really, our own product, humira. so it's not outside the possibility as this resolves. and really largely, as you've probably heard or seen, xeljanz has lost in-place share over that period.
so i do believe there's a little overhang in certain -- probably significant segments of rheumatology. so we are anxiously awaiting the resolution here of oral surveillance, which obviously has delayed our regulatory submissions, but it's not outside of the realm of possibility given the very significant differentiated data that we have in our packages that we could see an acceleration as things resolve. so we're going to anxiously be monitoring and certainly be prepared to anticipate any outcome there.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and steve, this is rick. on the contracting question, i'll handle that one. it varies quite a bit based on product and by managed care organization, but i'd say -- so it can be -- some of them can be as short as 12 months. it's probably more common to be in the 24-month range from a contracting standpoint.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from chris raymond with piper sandler. please ask your question.
chris raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks. just on the a beta program. i know you answered a few questions, but i think i heard you describe the product that you're targeting the plaques and not the soluble forms of a beta. just kind of maybe if you -- wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the driver of that going forward with that.
do you guys -- does your science sort of tell you that amyloid beta algomers, for example, are not a driver of the disease? or is this more of a decision that's driven by the regulatory precedence of approving -- targeting the a beta plaques? and then maybe also if you can give a little more detail on this molecule? is it likely an iv or possibly subcu delivered antibody? thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take that. with respect to the focus on plaque, i think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly from that point forward, you can see a benefit. so in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by pet, so below 20 centiloids and doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time.
and part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. so if you spend the entire period of a trial getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. and of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years, and they need really faster than that. so that's our focus on plaque.
with respect to different components and the role of oligomers, i think it's hard to tease that apart right now. what we know from the data is what i said, that getting patients to amyloid negativity. so reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit. whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result, i think, is an open question.
and we're going where the science tells us to go today. with respect to iv or subcu, i think it's early to answer that question. it's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose and then those forms that can be delivered. so for example, there are on-body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional 1 or 2 ml of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody.
so there are approaches that could be iv or subcu, but i think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out.
chris raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question please.
operator
tank you. it comes from luisa hector with berenberg. your line is open.
luisa hector -- berenberg -- analyst
hello. thank you for taking my question. sorry, going back to rinvoq again, but i just wanted to check that the approval of the pending indications isn't a particular gating item for your filing in uc. and then i see that you haven't changed your guidance for rinvoq for this year.
and i know previously, you've stated that would only ever be a small contribution this year. but rather than sales, i just wonder whether there's any particular savings on your launch costs this year due to the delay. and then maybe on tnb-383. again, i think i've understood this is now 100% belonging to you.
so just to check no impact from the amgen acquisition. and then when might we see a phase 2 start? it looks like you have a dose data all very compelling. so how soon could we be looking out for that trial start and data? thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
ok. this is mike. i'll start with the rinvoq question then pass it to rob. and then i'll come back for the 383 question.
with respect to the uc filing, the uc filing is not dependent on the approvals in the other indications. and obviously, the timing of review of the uc filing would carry it out to a point where those matters would, i think, based on any reasonable expectation, resolved.
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. then on your question regarding the guidance for rinvoq. so you're right, we did give guidance of $1.7 billion early this year, assuming we would have the new indications approved. we said that would be a minor contribution.
think of it in couple of hundred million dollar range. but given the strong performance out of the ra indication, we've maintained that guidance despite the fact that those accruals are delayed. there is some level of savings in terms of sg&a related to the approvals being delayed. but at the same time, we're investing in the business.
you look at what we're doing at aesthetics, obviously, other parts of the allergan business, there's opportunity to invest more broadly. so overall, sg&a is up because we are investing for long-term growth, but there is some level of savings associated with the rinvoq delays.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
with respect to 383, the bcma cd3 bispecific, you're correct, there is no impact of the amgen acquisition of teneobio. the asset would be ours and it would be unencumbered by anything related to the amgen acquisition. in terms of phase 2 timing, we plan to move forward very rapidly, not only with phase 2 but with phase 3 studies with this asset. we think the data that have been generated are very strong, very high levels of response, good levels at the vgpr or better threshold with a very good safety profile as well and a profile that would fit well with combination therapy and move to earlier lines of therapy.
so we'll advance the program aggressively, and we'll update on the specifics a little bit later on in the year.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, luisa. operator, next question please.
operator
our next question will come from daniel busby with rbc capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
daniel busby -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. i've got 2 questions. first, a bigger picture question on skyrizi and rinvoq. you've guided the peak sales for both products in the early 2030s.
there's been a lot of focus on near-term regulatory hurdles, particularly for rinvoq, but there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. so with that said, what do you view as the biggest potential longer-term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? and second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the delta variant and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
we go through a fairly rigorous, in fact, i'd say a very rigorous, long-range planning process where we evaluate what we think the competitive alternatives might be and the profile of our assets versus other assets. and i would say, as we look at rinvoq and skyrizi and the clinical data that has been generated, it's certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. i don't see anything on the horizon that would make it in a time frame that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long-range planning process. so yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas.
it's having the right kind of asset, the right kind of clinical performance and then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. and so the bottom line is i think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. as it relates to the delta variant, i think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume. we don't assume dramatic changes in the u.s.
or other major markets around the world from where we are today. we're not assuming major levels of what probably in certain markets either that are currently in lockdowns like australia as an example. we're in many of the asian markets outside of china and singapore. so i think we've properly represented it.
i think the healthcare system in the u.s. in particular, i think is the experience that we had last year, i think, tells us that the healthcare system can much better treat these patients. and we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in a shift in the u.s. from a lockdown standpoint.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, daniel. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
it will come from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. your line is open, sir.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning and thank you for squeezing me in. sorry but one more on rinvoq first. curious why you think europe doesn't seem as concerned with the jak class the way the fda has been since you got the positive opinion on atopic for both doses there.
and how do you see uptake in europe versus the u.s. overall? is there a difference in perception you think in those regions with the class? and then regarding vraylar for how are the phase 3 studies gone overall? did you change anything with respect to enrollment numbers or sites during the course of the pandemic since these phase 3 data coming soon? and have you done any more work sizing up the potential market opportunity where you think it would be used most for mdd, what types of patients? thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll start and then i'll pass it over to jeff for some additional comments. with respect to rinvoq and the regulatory environment and the prescriber perception, prescriber environment between europe and the u.s., we do see differences. and the european authorities and the european prescribing base seems to place less emphasis on these signals and view them more specifically to the molecules that generated the data than the u.s.
why that is, i can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data and those impressions have differed somewhat. as you've said, for atopic derm, we got the positive opinion from the chmp for both the 15 and 30-milligram doses. we think the data are very supportive of that decision, and we look forward to launching that indication in europe. and we think it's going to be an important additional indication as it will be in the u.s.
when we do get to approval. with respect to uptake in europe, jeff, i don't know if you want to comment on that.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. as i mentioned in my remarks, the uptake on rinvoq in many major markets is very, very strong. now as you know, waiting for reimbursement takes a little bit more time than the u.s. but as i highlighted, we have in-play leadership.
and this is including the tnfs, the biosimilars in germany, france, canada, for example. so it's quite strong. i think another point that i'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with psa and as. there's -- there appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint as countries like germany start to introduce psa and as, the entire rinvoq molecule starts to accelerate and move faster.
and so again, given the last question i answered, we're anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there. so it's quite strong. and as i highlighted again and mike mentioned, our label here in atopic derm is going to look quite strong in the european markets. mike, maybe you can hit on mdd and then i'll address the market structure there.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
with respect to vraylar and mdd, we did a deep dive on the phase 3 studies shortly after closing the acquisition of allergan. and what i would say is we found that the studies were very well designed. we were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. we looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population enrolled.
so you look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can see if you're enrolling the right patient population. and we believe we were. all of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. and so we feel good about the design characteristics of that study, and we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes.
but we did do that deep dive to be sure of that. as i said, what we found was, in fact, reassuring. with respect to the market opportunity, i'll just make a couple of comments, and i'll hand it off to jeff for some more detail. but what i would say is depression, obviously, is a substantial indication and it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents.
about 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like ssris or snris. and so there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. and obviously, this is an adjunctive mdd indication. so that would be the population that we would be looking at.
jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. i mean if we look at the market structure, obviously, you have schizophrenia, which is a relatively modest market, and we have a good growing position there with our existing indication. and then you have the prescriptions and really the different bipolar segments. and what i would say about not the big depression market but the adjunctive mdd market that mike spoke about, it's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment.
so adjunctive mdd, if the studies were to progress as we see is really gives us a chance to access a market that's equally sized to the one that we're competing in today. so it's quite attractive as we continue to look for the final readout of those trials.

operator
good morning. thank you for standing by, and welcome to the abbvie second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
ma'am, you may proceed.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
good morning and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; rob michael, executive vice president and chief financial officer; and jeff stewart, executive vice president, commercial operations. joining us for the q&a portion of the call is laura schumacher, vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary. before we get started, i remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of zenpep and biohaven. references to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange.
following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our second-quarter performance and outlook. and then jeff, mike and rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail.
abbvie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. these results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic.
in immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. skyrizi and rinvoq continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. in neuroscience, vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of ubrelvy, the leading oral cgrp for acute migraine, continues to exceed our expectations. aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-covid levels, exceeding our internal expectations.
we're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and covid-related pent-up demand. rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium term. and we are raising our full-year guidance once again for aesthetics. while the recovery across the abbvie portfolio is going very well in aggregate in certain disease areas like cll and hcv we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic.
we expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. one of abbvie's greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. across abbvie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace, and our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers where protocols and guidelines permit. i'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level.
as an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the allergan transaction and integration. we just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which i'd say has gone exceptionally well. we're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction with accretion performing above our original projections. but i'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring allergan, with 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy allergan's historical performance.
our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year to date, we are once again raising our full-year 2021 eps guidance. we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth.
as you'll hear from mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. in closing, i'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business. which has positioned us well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come. with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.
jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. i'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. skyrizi and rinvoq continue to have significant impact on abbvie's growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. skyrizi global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally.
in the u.s., skyrizi continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. skyrizi total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to humira. internationally, skyrizi has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including canada, france and japan. rinvoq is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis.
we continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the u.s. ra market. where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on rinvoq strong benefit risk profile. internationally, rinvoq access and share continue to ramp nicely in ra with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries.
we are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of psa and as across several ous countries. and we look forward to the approval and commercialization of rinvoq in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent chmp positive opinion for both the 15 and 30-milligram doses. humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the u.s. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis.
in hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. abbvie maintains a strong leadership position in cll with a combined portfolio including both imbruvica and venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. in the u.s., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in cll, which remain below pre-covid levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including venclexta and other btk inhibitors.
venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. we're particularly pleased with the performance in aml with robust share in the u.s. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the eu and asia. in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis.
we continue to see strong momentum with vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. and ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations.
feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting ubrelvy rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. we continue to believe there is substantial room for long-term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. in migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of atogepant, our oral cgrp for episodic migraine.
we are very encouraged with the efficacy profile of atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo as well as the overall percentage of responder rates in patients. now the launch of atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly. we remain on track for a u.s. regulatory decision in september.
botox therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. in chronic migraine, botox therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis, mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre-covid levels. and we also saw double-digit comparable operational revenue growth for both creon and linzess.
so overall, i'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. and with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d programs. mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology, where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top-line results from the phase 3 maintenance studies for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and skyrizi in crohn's disease. in the rinvoq uc maintenance study, both the 15- and 30-milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52.
in the induction portion of the program, rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. and the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with rinvoq maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the 1-year mark. in fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of rinvoq resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in uc clinical studies. with the 30-milligram rinvoq dose, 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and 68% achieved steroid-free remission.
we are very pleased with how rinvoq performed from a safety perspective as well. in this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events, including serious and severe events, were higher in the placebo group than in either rinvoq dose group. additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for mace, vte and malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between rinvoq group and placebo. these results provide further evidence that rinvoq has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.
we're also nearing completion of the crohn's disease program for rinvoq and expect to see data from the first phase 3 induction study later this year. results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. we also saw very impressive results from skyrizi in the maintenance phase of our crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360-milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. importantly, when we look at the most stringent end points, we see strong separation between skyrizi 360 milligrams and control, with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission and 29% for deep remission compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52.
we remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for rinvoq in uc and skyrizi in crohn's in the coming months. in the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for rinvoq in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. in june, rinvoq received a positive chmp opinion in europe, recommending both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. this chmp opinion puts us on track for european approval in august.
when approved, atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for rinvoq in europe. regarding our supplemental ndas in the u.s., we recently announced that we were notified by the fda that they would not need our pdufa action dates for rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and closing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis, which were in late june for psoriatic arthritis and as and mid-july for atopic dermatitis. the agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance study, indicated that they -- indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. the fda has not requested any additional safety analysis for rinvoq since the pdufa dates were missed.
while there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. we remain confident in the benefit risk profile for rinvoq across all indications, and we'll continue to work with the fda to bring rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. in our early stage immunology pipeline, we recently began 2 new trials for abbv-154, our tnf steroid conjugate. we initiated a definitive dose-ranging study in patients with ra and also started our phase 2 study in polymyalgia rheumatica.
later this year, we expect to begin the phase 2 study for 154 in crohn's disease. also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. while this cd40 antagonist demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. as a result, we will not be advancing ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis.
in oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. at the recent asco and eha meetings, data were presented from the glow and captivate studies, evaluating a fixed duration imbruvica and venclexta regimen in cll patients. results from these 2 studies demonstrated that the all-oral, fixed duration imbruvica plus venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extend progression-free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum of age and fitness status for cll patients. we plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new fixed duration treatment option to cll patients once approved.
earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher-risk mds patients based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing phase 1b study. we expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for venclexta in mds. also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a phase 1 study evaluating the bcma cd3 bispecific antibody, tnb-383b, in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort.
based on these promising results, we exercised our right to acquire tnb-383b from teneobio. we expect the transaction to close in the coming months, and we'll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. this is a highly competitive area. but based on the data to date, we believe this bcma cd3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best-in-class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma.
we continue to make good progress with the navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized phase 3 trials in both the frontline and relapsed/refractory setting as well as a single-arm phase 2 study. based on feedback from the fda, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized phase 3 data, together with the phase 2 trial results. we expect the phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. in neuroscience, we recently completed the phase 2 proof-of-concept studies for two assets, elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and abbv-8e12 in alzheimer's disease.
in their respective studies, either asset met the efficacy endpoints of the trial. and we will be discontinuing the development of elezanumab in ms and 8e12 in alzheimer's disease. given the enormous unmet need in alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease-modifying therapies, and we continue to pursue a range of approaches. we have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development.
these include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in alzheimer's disease, such as our trem2 and cd33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic through novel mechanism such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the u.s. there has been an increased focus on a beta directed programs. we have monitored this area closely over the last several years.
and based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an a beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities or aria. we have profiled a number of a-beta antibodies preclinically, and we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. we expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for abbv-951 in advanced parkinson's disease.
we recently completed an interim analysis in the first of two phase 3 studies were our subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy comparable to duopa after six months of treatment. the primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. in this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off-time and a 41% increase in normalized on-time without troublesome dyskinesia. patients also benefited from 951 24-hour continuous levodopa-carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in morning off-time.
full data from the six month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. data from a second phase 3 study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year or early next year. and lastly, in eye care, at the recent meeting for the american society for cataract and refractive surgery, we presented results from the phase 3 gemini 1 study, evaluating our topical eye drop, agn-190584, for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. in this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes and sustained vision improvements for up to six hours.
584 has the potential to be convenient, on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. so in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. and we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our second-quarter performance and financial outlook.
rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, mike. starting with second-quarter results. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion, up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange.
the adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. this includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense of 21.2% of sales. net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. as rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint.
excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. this guidance now contemplates full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. at current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. this implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion.
included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions: we now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from botox cosmetic and approximately $1.4 billion from juvederm. we now expect restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. for ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. for women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million.
and for mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. looking at the p&l for 2021. we are now forecasting adjusted r&d investment of approximately $6.7 million and adjusted sg&a expense of approximately $11.9 million. all other full-year assumptions remain unchanged.
as we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. finally, we continue to make great progress on our allergan transaction commitments.
we are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including botox, vraylar, ubrelvy and eye care. we have also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. and we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. we expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt pay-down by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023.
this will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4x by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. in closing, abbvie has once again delivered outstanding performance, and we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. in the interests of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. operator first question please.
",2021-Q2,ABBV
0.9999,,-0.7030000000000001,,":
operator
thank you, ms. shea. our first question comes from geoffrey porges with leerink. your line is open, sir.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
thank you very much. rick, i guess i'll jump in with the big one that i think is still the overhang for the stock, which is the rinvoq outlook. you have 15 billion out there for 2025 in combined skyrizi, rinvoq, forecast guidance. and i'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the puts and takes.
skyrizi doing really well, but some overhangs for rinvoq. is that 15 billion still achievable? do you think you're trending above that? or do you have to make up a shortfall? thanks
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, jeffrey, this is rick. it's a great question. what i'd say is the following.
if i look at skyrizi i would tell you that skyrizi's performance is very, very impressive. jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total trxs are and it's very close to passing humira now, which in this short period of time is, frankly, a surprise, how quickly it has ran. so i think that's a very positive case. if i look at rinvoq, actually, the in-play share looks very good.
now we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to do behind t&fs that, that will have some impact on the frontline patients that we're capturing now. and so we will see that impact. having said that, i would say that when i look at rinvoq's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more toward second-line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or two later than this, where we would have driven that. we have very good data to be able to support that.
the other thing i'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these two assets. we have ad, which is a very significant opportunity for us. we have psa and is a very significant opportunity. but next year, we have the ibd indication, coming out.
and i'd say there, when we gave the $15 million forecast, the performance that was in our tpp, or our target product profile, that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. and so i think that's a very significant opportunity for us and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. we want to see what the final label looks like from the agency.
and then we'll be in a position, i think, to come out and until the investor community exactly what we think. the only other thing i'd say is i think if you go back five, six years ago, what we were trying to accomplish with the company, we're basically trying to accomplish with the company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace humira in the marketplace and be superior to humira. these two assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. so i think everything i know about these two assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expected of them, even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect.
second thing is we built a significant hem/onc portfolio that when i look at the pipeline behind imbruvica and venclexta, i think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. and then with the allergan acquisition, i couldn't be more pleased. and aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing at an outstanding level. i think migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive and eye care is another one.
and so we now have multiple assets and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. and our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on. we expect to see the impact of the loe on humira in '23. and immediately be able to grow beyond that, starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point.
and regardless of what happens with rinvoq's label, i have a high level of confidence we can continue to do that. rob, anything you'd add?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would just add that, obviously, with the confidence, we have in the dividend increase we announced today, we feel very strong about the long-term outlook. we haven't backed off on the high single-digit growth in '25 and beyond. you look at the portfolio we've assembled, if you look at the assets we have today, you look at our pipeline, you look at the bd work we've been doing over the last couple of years with some nice licensing deals, and we still feel very confident in the outlook for this business.
geoffrey porges -- svb leerink -- analyst
great. thank you.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, geoffrey. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from andrew baum with citi. your line is open, sir.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
yeah. thank you. you flip back to the other side of rinvoq, skyrizi, and talk to humira. could you talk to your comfort level with where consensus currently has humira pegged and the anticipated scale and scope of the erosion? and then second, in relation to your ongoing alvotech pending court case, could you just confirm whether if they prevail that would effectively invalidate the signed settlements with the other biosimilar players, meaning that you would have a number of players cutting that much quicker onto the market with anticipated price and volume impact.
thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. andrew, this is rick. so i'll cover the second one, the alvotech one. i'm going to have rob cover the first one.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we've seen movement in terms of consensus numbers since we've given just some direction on how to model it. i think right now, consensus in '23 sell-in consensus has about 41% erosion in the u.s. in '23. and we've said -- think about it in terms of 45% based on what we saw in europe in year one, plus or minus 10%, given the differences in the payer landscape.
-- in the u.s. versus other markets. so we have seen the humira consensus move. today, it's at 41%.
so it's a lot closer than it was a year ago.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. andrew, this is rick. i'll cover the alvotech situation. so as you know, we're in litigation with alvotech.
i think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. so in this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in humira. and as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around humira. but these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patterns.
many of these patents were challenged through the ipr process and upheld by the patent office. so it gives you some idea of the strength of these patents. so the first thing i'd say to you is we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. there will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that.
which will bring into the portfolio, the rest of the patents that we think alvotech infringes. so there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one. but i can tell you, we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents. to specifically answer your question, if they were to prevail, which i don't believe they will, then it would accelerate the other patent settlements, yes, that is correct.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, andrew. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. it comes from chris schott with jpmorgan. your line is open, sir.
chris schott -- jpmorgan chase & co. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you so much. just one quick follow-up on rinvoq and the upcoming indications. i guess do you see a scenario where you are unable to get the drug approved in these pending indications, particularly ad over the next few months? or is your view based on all the interactions, etc, that this is largely, i guess, a label and maybe line of therapy kind of discussion and decision with the agency? and then my second question was on botox aesthetics, very healthy growth you're seeing here.
we're now coming up against even some more normalized comps and you're still seeing the growth rate very, very healthy. just are we still seeing catch-up usage in this? or is this just really underlying demand at this point? and just a little bit more color about just how you're thinking about kind of the near-term growth trajectory? i know you talked about high single digits over time. but just as we may look out to '22, '23, could this remain kind of a mid-teens type of growth rate product over that window? thank you so much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
ok. thanks, chris. this is mike. i'll take the first one, and then rick will take the second part of your question.
with respect to rinvoq and the three new indications, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. we remain very confident in those files, and we remain very confident in approval decisions. the gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around ra, which is a process that is well underway. and we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed.
and again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings. we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that ra decision for ankylosing spondylitis as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. and so that 1 might be on a slightly different time frame.
but we remain very confident in that approval as well.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. chris, this is rick. on botox, i think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. and that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated totally dedicated aesthetics organization because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the u.s., but in china as an example, you see very similar kinds of dynamics.
and so focusing that team purely on aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. the second one is when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. we believe that the business was being underfunded in a way both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. and so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result.
and then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. and what you're actually seeing now, i think, is we are driving the market. we're bringing more patients into the category and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. is there still some pent-up demand i would tell you, it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it, right? because remember, those practices reopened in the u.s.
in the summer of 2020. and so that's a long time to have pent-up demand. but it's impossible to tell one way or another. so i would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients.
one of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. and so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. they don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus go into pillars as an example. so the data is very clear.
if you look at the u.s. as an example, toxins and pillars are growing high 30% the market. we're growing at about the same rate. maybe a little bit lower on pillars, but about that rate on toxins.
when we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. and so i think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. when we say across the decade-high single digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rate, the business is getting bigger and bigger. so, therefore, the percentage will come down a bit.
but i'll tell you, i'm very optimistic about this in this market. and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market that can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. it's a very good business.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, chris. operator? will take the next question, please.
operator
thank you. that comes from tim anderson with wolfe research. your line is open, sir.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. i wanted to ask a question on humira in 2023. and just really trying to nail down what's in that erosion guidance of 45%, plus or minus 10%. that's sales erosion, not volume, correct? i'm trying to think through what happens to the u.s.
rebate stream in 2023, which is likely in the billions of dollars. do you think you'll retain favorable formulary positioning even with biosimilars? in which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss? or do you think it becomes disadvantaged on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates and that flows through to the bottom line. to me, i just wonder if your guidance on erosion is frankly too conservative or i should say, too aggressive because those rebate dynamics in the u.s. may make us a more durable market than ex u.s.
where those rebate dynamics don't exist.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
yes. so, tim, this is rick. maybe rob and i will tag team this one. i'll start.
i think the guidance we laid out of 45 or 48% whichever is the latest number, plus or minus 10%, it's still a guidance that we feel pretty comfortable with. to your point about, is the bulk of it priced? it is. even if you look at the international markets, it's about one-third, two-third, and maybe slightly higher than that. meaning two-third of its price, one-third of it is volume.
and i would expect that we will maintain a significant part of the volume. obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our managed care strategy is -- but what i would tell you is we're close enough now to that '23 time frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly, humira is one of those for 2023. and i think it is logical to assume that we will want to maintain that formulary position. and we've been pretty effective at doing that historically.
so i believe we'll be pretty effective at doing it again. rob, anything you want to add?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
just as a reminder, i mean so we gave that -- we were using europe as an analog, but keep in mind that the u.s. system is very, very different. it's why we gave you a range. and so as we get closer to '23, obviously, we'll give more specific guidance on the u.s.
but we were communicating with more directional information based on the experience we saw with europe. keep in mind there were four biosimilars that came in the market at that time, there'll be more biosimilars coming in the u.s. markets. there's a different level of competitive intensity, but also it's a very different payer landscape.
so it's something to keep in mind.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, tim. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. it comes from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. your line is open, sir.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. a couple on neuro that had some recent wins. so first on vraylar and the phase iii studies in mdd.
in 1 study, you hit on the 1.5-milligram dose, but not the three-milligram dose it was close, but not statistically significant. so will that matter to the fda? maybe you could remind us what doses hit in the previous phase three and now that you have the full data set, how do you think vraylar will stack up competitively in the ndd space? and then just quickly, on migraine, a little bit more how the initial launch has gone for qulipta? and how has that been rolled into the botox and ubrelvy offering? and just your confidence about the reimbursement you said going into the first half of next year. thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
ok. this is mike. i'll take the first part of your question, and then jeff will take the second part of your question. with respect to vraylar mdd, in the study that you described, the 1.5-milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005, so double zero five.
and that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. and then as you point out, in the three-milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a p-value that was very small. the nominal p-value was 0.073 if we round. so when you look at that overall study to our eye, it clearly shows an effect in mdd.
now the second phase three study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends. and across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small, and many of them were lower than 0.05. and i'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies. even with the classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some studies that read out positive in some studies that are negative.
and so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. and it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago. that was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. now that study looked at slightly different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration.
it was the upper two of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. so we had two positive studies, and that's important. because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive phase three study. and is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive, and we feel comfortable that, that is the case here.
and lastly, what i'd say is if you look at the precedent and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described are not at all uncommon. in fact, i think they're very common among approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive mdd like rexulti. so overall, we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway and will stack up very nicely to competitors, and we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. so with that, i'll turn it over to jeff.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. thank you, mike. look, it's a meaningful opportunity for sure. when we look at the market sizes, about 60 million total prescriptions for the adjunctive mdd market.
and that's very similar to the bipolar market that we operate in now. so it's a very meaningful opportunity for us. if you think about the -- what mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, i think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the vraylar is very attractive, which is why it's the fast and growing agent. so the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall.
and i think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy, a very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable, and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. so when you start to see the potential for an agent like vraylar that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of media, mixed episodes, and depression, and then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive. so we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to vraylar's overall profile.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
jeff, do you want to cover the second question?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah, perfect. the second question you had was quarter. and qulipta, it's very early. we just introduced the product with our full commercial promotion.
as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now, as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force, which shows you how important, we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. so we have an entire sales team out there that is launching qulipta and now also focused on ubrelvy. and the early feedback has been very strong. what we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of qulipta for prevention.
we see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which as mike has said before and i've said before, is on the very high end of preventative performance. so 60% of patients in our trials achieved a greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. and almost 30% have a complete control, 100% decrease in their migraine days. so that's very compelling in terms of this qulipta power.
also, physicians like the simple everyday dosing once a day. and so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. so we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridge prescriptions until our -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as i mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year. we should ramp similar to ubrelvy, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the u.s.
so quite good early feedback on the launch. and again, we think that the three assets together our unique competitive positioning for abbvie.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, gary. operator, next question, please.
operator
our next question is from matthew harrison with morgan stanley. your line is open, sir.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. good morning. thanks for taking my question. i guess two for me.
so one, if i could just follow up on cgrp. i'm curious, obviously, you have a different strategy than your competitor when it comes to the prophylactic market. i'm just wondering how you think where your sources of patients are going to come from? are you expecting more transitions from injectables? or do you think there are going to be more de novo patients? and if you could just talk about that a little bit. and then secondly, on regenx, could you just talk about your confidence in the data there? obviously, there was some inflammation there, though it did seem self-limiting.
i'm just curious how you think about that and how you think about that. impacting the profile because, obviously, in other gene therapy products in the eye inflammation has sometimes proven to be pretty significant as a long-term sequela. thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
jeff, why don't you --
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes, i'll take the first one. thanks. so in terms of the source of business, we think that qulipta is going to source business from two primary areas. first is the big headache specialists, the big neurologists, we think, absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable mabs in favor of the orals and certainly, in favor of it, i think that this is viewed as very attractive.
in many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow, it looks like a very strong mabs in a single oral pill. so that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. i think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a calling on a substantial amount of high-prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of mabs, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. and so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean toward the mabs because of the injectable nature of those, etc.
so think we're going to have a good balance between those two sources of business, and that's quite attractive for us right now.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take the question regarding regenx. we're very encouraged by the recent data. if we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with subretinal delivery.
now that's an or procedure, but it gives clear proof of concept for the approach and shows that we can get durable control and that component of the program is already in phase three. and then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. so that is a delivery method that can be done in office. it's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection.
and that is also showing very good promise. we're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which, quite frankly, is sooner than we expected to see them before that study. had started to deliver results. and the tolerability is very good.
if one looks at the inflammation that is reported in the regenx trials, it's very different in its nature and its severity than that that has been seen with other agents. it's principally anterior chamber or exclusively anterior chamber. there's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation. it is readily treated with topical steroids and generally resolves without any difficulty and, in fact, quite rapidly.
and it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. other approaches have required that. so these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront and are responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. and the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids given is they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed.
so we're very confident with it. and again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. and we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program. and the views we've heard from them are supportive of what i just described.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, matthew. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from steve scala with cowen. your line is open, sir.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. i have a few questions. a couple of follow-ups. but how would you describe the nature and the tone of conversations with fda regarding rinvoq's new label in ra would you say you're pleased with how things are going? is the outcome unclear to abbvie at this juncture? or is the outcome obvious and in line with what the fda had in its statement in september.
so that's the first question. second question, to my knowledge, vraylar has shown superiority to placebo but not generics in mdd. so how would abbvie establish it as a leading mdd agent given the presence of lower-cost alternatives? and then lastly, any thoughts on the soliton acquisition relative to its closing. thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
ok. this is mike. i'll start, and then rick will take the question regarding soliton. with respect to the tone of conversations with the fda for rinvoq, i would describe them as productive.
with respect to your question specifically about the ra label, those discussions are productive as well. i would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early september, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. and i would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. and so as i mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all three of them.
with respect to vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in the space. they're very challenging. it is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. so these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to vraylar are one of the most commonly used agents in this space.
so we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
and steve, it's jeff. just to build on mike's point. i mean, if you think about the size of vraylar now, approaching $1.8 billion, it has a 2.5 share in terms of the antipsychotic market. so it's a low share, high value in growth areas.
so when you think about most of our business is already stepped through in some cases, one or two of the generics. the problem is that these patients are so fragile. they just don't respond well. so we would still anticipate that with the approval, a new approval for mdd, you're still going to have step therapy and other approaches in the marketplace, but that -- there's still a very, very nice commercial opportunity.
that's just the way the markets work today.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
all right. thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so this is rick, steve. on soliton, as you know, we obviously announced the -- our intention to acquire the company. and submitted for approval. we did receive a second request.
maybe just to frame a bit why we're interested in this area. we tend to look at this market where the third major leg of the stool in aesthetics is body contouring. and this is a good fit with cool faulting and pool home. obviously, cool sculpting is focused more on reduction of fat in targeted areas, and cool tones more focused on the area of enhancing muscle tone in specific areas.
this particular asset is designed to reduce cellulite. we don't have a position in cellulite now. so there's not any kind of competitive overlap in that area. having said that, we are responding to the ftc's inquiry.
we believe that's going reasonably well. so we would expect this to be resolved at some point here in the future. i can't tell you a specific date, but i would expect it have a positive outcome over a period of time here.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, steve. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from vamil divan with mizuho securities. your line is open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thanks so much for taking my question. so just maybe one more just on vraylar following up on the other comments. i think before you talked about this being as maybe a sort of multibillion-dollar type opportunity in mdd. is that still sort of the lines you're thinking now that you've seen the data that you disclosed today? and then the second one, just going back to rinvoq, and obviously sounds like you're still pretty confident on that product's outlook.
but i'm just curious if that's changed any of your sort of priorities as you think about business development, specifically in immunology, sort of the need for maybe look at other oral agents that might be in development there, just sort of how you're thinking about the broader bd landscape there. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. i think if you look at the -- as i highlighted that the market sizes are roughly the same. however, the competitive context is quite a bit different and the competitive set is a little bit different. so we view it again as an important incremental opportunity that even with low incremental share that we can drive vraylar to that multibillion-dollar guidance that we look at.
we do think it's an incremental catalyst and an exciting approach if it were to be approved.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take the rinvoq question. so as you point out, yes, we are very confident in rinvoq as a molecule overall. we've talked about the progress on the ra indication and our confidence in the new indications, both those that are under review and indications where we have data but have not yet submitted like the ibd indications.
and so we feel that it's going to be an important part of our portfolio and the treatment armamentarium going forward. so having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look to for the best opportunities. so i wouldn't say it's changed our focus in any way or changed our approach. but we will continue to look for novel therapies that can raise the bar on the standard of care across a number of areas, the current indications where we are already playing, and new indications that have fewer treatment options areas like lupus and scleroderma.
so the rinvoq situation has not changed that strategy in any way.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, vamil. operator? will take next question, please.
operator
thank you. it was from ronny gal with bernstein. your line is open, sir.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. i got a clarification and then a couple of questions. first, rick, you kind of mentioned regarding alvotech about the acceleration clauses. and i just want to clarify if this is on district decision or appeal.
given the timing, it actually makes quite a bit of difference. then the two questions i have first are interchangeability for humira. do you think this will matter in the marketplace, we are hearing different things from the large payers. what is your take here and what is going abbvie's position about this? and the second question is the last dress we've seen from d.c.
regarding the infrastructure build does not include a reduction of out-of-pocket costs in medicare. we're still hearing from context, this still might be the case that it is still included. if you can comment on this issue, do you expect it to be included and the impact it might have on abbvie's business.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so, ronnie, this is rick. on alvotech, obviously, the agreements that we have with the other biosimilar players are confidential. so i'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. what i would tell you is what i said before.
i mean, we are highly confident in our position with this ip. this ip has been challenged multiple times. and we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail. so i think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but i don't -- i wouldn't give it a lot of merits.
second, on interchangeable humira. as we discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, recently year and a half or so ago, we did assume at that point that there were going to be two interchangeable biosimilars. it does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. so i think it will have an impact, but it's consistent with what we had assumed.
and so we've essentially taking that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you and the estimates that we provided you. on drug pricing in the u.s. look, i would say it's a very fluid situation. it's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are.
you are correct. if you look at the framework that came out yesterday, essentially talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated and he didn't talk about much else. so look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference or out-of-pocket costs for patients and making them lower for medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time, a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. and as we've said before, we think industry could play a role in that as one of the participants.
and we would hope that we will get back to that because i think we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket cost for these patients.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, ronny. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoff meacham with bank of america. your line is now open, sir.
geoff meacham -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. hey, guys. thanks so much for the question. i just have two quick ones probably for mike.
to follow up on rinvoq, i know it's been asked a lot, but you have a number of labeling scenarios that could play out just with respect to dose or tnf requirement or language on black box or any maybe any limit on duration. is there one of those items that has more of an impact than the others? i'm just trying to think about what informs your assumptions. and the second question on cystic fibrosis. when you look to the upcoming proof-of-concept data readout, is there a minimal effect size or sort of profile that you're looking for that would justify moving to a larger scale phase three? thanks so much.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
so i'll take the rinvoq question first and then make some comments on cf. what i would say about rinvoq is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in september. so that's principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have. and in fact, all agents in immunology have some degree of this that treat similar conditions to rinvoq.
for example, the tnfs have some of the same, but not all of the same warnings. so updating that section of the label is part of our base case. and then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around tnf inadequate response forms our base case. and those are the two factors that we're considering.
we would not anticipate any limit in duration of therapy, for example. and the question dosed principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file because we have just a single dose in the other files and the files that are in the rheumatology space. and we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. so it's really those two dimensions and how those translate into specific language in ra.
and then, of course, how they translate to the other indications because tnfs are not the standard of care in all indications. they are not used in atopic dermatitis. so then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs.
and again, we feel very confident in the files that we put forward and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. with respect to cf and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there or what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. obviously, the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is vertex, and so that's what we would be benchmarking ourselves against. i would say, at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages.
but what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute fev1 points. a small number of absolute fev1 points might not sound much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, geoff. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from luisa hector with berenberg. your line is now open, ma'am.
luisa hector -- berenberg -- analyst
thank you. good morning, and sorry, i still have a couple more on rinvoq. i just wanted to understand whether the label updates in ra and then the approvals in the new indications can essentially all happen on the same day? or is the gating in the ra update? and then there's still a bit more work to be done for the new indications. and then looking on to the uc filing, is the acceptance of that filing in any way dependent on the ra label being resolved first? or that's free to be accepted as a filing while the label update is still outstanding? thank you.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
this is mike. i'll take those two questions. so with respect to the ongoing reviews. what i would say is the discussions around the ra label update and the new indications that are under review are going on simultaneously.
and there is some level of interdependence. in other words, we need to understand where the ra label will land because some of those elements like the warning super cautions will translate over to the other indications because, in the u.s., you get on label for the molecule, that applies across all of the indications. so there's some interdependency. that's why getting the ra label update resolved is a gating factor whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, i think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail.
but we would expect psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time frame after that label update. as i mentioned, we are adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is smallest of the three indications. and so that one might be on a slightly different time frame as the agency reviews those new data. with respect to the uc filing, the ra label update is not on critical path to file acceptance.
what the agency looks at when they look at file acceptances have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file? is it in an appropriate format that they can review? are there any significant efficiencies? and of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted. so we would not, in any way, anticipate any challenges there. and the ra safety label update is not a gating factor for that file acceptance.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, lisa. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from chris raymond with piper sandler. your line is open.
allison bratzel -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is ali bratzel on for chris. so on abbv-951 in parkinson's, we're just hoping you could put some of the safety findings from the phase three trial in context particularly the imbalance in hallucination psychosis and the 22%, i think, treatment discontinuation rates.
basically, just how did that safety profile stack up against your expectations? and how would this translate into real-world use of 951? thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
so this is mike. i'll take that question. with respect to the data for 951, we're very pleased with the data. there's very strong efficacy.
and the safety is within our expectations. it matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. what's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control parkinson's disease through other measures and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease, for example, with orals or with other approaches. and so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context.
with respect to treatment discontinuations, what i would say is the treatment discontinuation. the rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump-like devices used across a range of conditions. most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases. and there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances.
but again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. and keep in mind, this is a very, very large population, this advanced parkinson's population only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how they can be delivered. we think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. with respect to hallucinations, we know that that is on mechanism for levodopa and carbidopa and it's essentially evidence that we are delivering levodopa and carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods.
and it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. and what i would point to is in the other direction, the oral group, the control group that got oral levodopa-carbidopa, had more falls. and that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data because we know falls are common in parkinson's disease patients. so we need to keep that in mind and with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use.
when we look at how this will impact our oil use, again, keep in mind that a very broad population, only a very small segment of which can access the kind of therapies that they need to control their disease. therapies like [inaudible] which is transformative, but takes a surgical gastric tube. it's actually threaded into the small bowel to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. so this is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy, and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, ali. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
that will come from josh schimmer with evercore isi. your line is open, sir.
josh schimmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for asking me. can you talk about the current contracting season with payers for humira and whether think you'll be able to lock in multi-year contracts either now to extend to 2023 or next year to extend to 2024. and then i'm surprised you're not more bullish with your guidance for the migraine franchise given the strong trajectory, it's on already.
any reason i think there's going to be a significant plateau in the years ahead. thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yeah. it's jeff. so typically, when we start to negotiate with the payers in the spring of the year for the following year. and typically, those contracts can be multi-year contracts, maybe 2-year contracts.
so really, that's sort of the season where we'll have, as rob and rick said, we'll have probably some more guidance over how things are shaping up for '23 and possibly '24, depending on the posture of the payers and how those things work out. so we're not quite there yet. i think that what i can say is we're quite confident based on the timing that i described in terms of general cycles in terms of where we're going to be for our portfolio, certainly in '22. in terms of qulipta, look, we are off to a very good start.
i can tell you that ubrelvy continues to run a pace that total oral cgrp market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions and it's still early, and that would be us and nurtec in the acute segment. and at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with triptans or some other issues. so we still have clearly some runway to go. it's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the mabs so far.
they certainly tripled the market size how will both of these orals and particularly in oral like qulipta in terms of the market development run a pace. it's encouraging for sure, particularly if you have all three of these agents in the market and the investment behind it. right now, though, we feel quite comfortable with the $1 billion opportunity for both of the orals.

operator
thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president of investor relations.
ma'am, you may proceed.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me, today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman, and president; rob michael, executive vice president and chief financial officer; and jeff stewart, executive vice president, commercial operations. before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.
additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance. these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.
unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis which includes full current year and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of zenpep and biocase. references to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll discuss our third quarter performance and outlook, and then jeff, mike, and rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress, and financial results in more detail. abbvie continues to perform very well.
we once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balanced growth across each of the major growth platforms. we continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where skyrizi and rinvoq have established very strong launch trajectories. these two assets are either approved, under regulatory review, or in late-stage development across all of humira's major indications, and we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to abbvie's long-term growth.
aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. our dedicated global aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and pillars, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. we are once again raising our full year guidance for aesthetics this quarter, and we view this portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade.
our neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter and we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of qulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. our hematological oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter despite a protracted market recovery in cll, which remains below pre-covid levels. beyond the significant contributions of imbruvica and venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. these include navitoclax for myelofibrosis, eculizumab for b-cell malignancies, abbv-383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for aml and mds as well as ubrelvy for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of allergan. our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. overall, i'm extremely pleased with our momentum, and we are once again raising our full year 2021 eps guidance. we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67 reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint.
additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we're announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.30 per share to $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in february 2022. since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. in summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. we've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential, giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. we continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. i'll start with immunology, where we remain well-positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis.
global humira sales were more than $5.4 billion, up 5.2% on an operational basis with 10.1% revenue growth in the u.s., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. skyrizi is performing extremely well. global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. in the u.s., skyrizi's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36%, more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor.
skyrizi's total prescription share in the u.s. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to humira. internationally, skyrizi continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. this compelling share performance will be further supported by two important near-term enhancements: the availability of more simple delivery forms for skyrizi as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis.
first, we recently launched the new and convenient skyrizi single-dose 150-milligram self-injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. the market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes skyrizi the only quarterly dose brand that is available in a single self-injectable pen for patients. second, we are preparing for the global launch of skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis as we near approval decisions in both the u.s. and europe.
we received a chmp positive opinion earlier this month with anticipated approval in europe by year-end, and we continue to expect fda approval early next year. the addition of this indication, once approved, will round out skyrizi's dermatology label and give patients with psa access to a new compelling therapeutic option. we are also making excellent progress with skyrizi's development in crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for u.s. regulatory review with commercialization expected next year.
rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. total in-play ra share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the u.s. as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world.
internationally, rinvoq's share continues to ramp in ra and we are making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of psa, as, and atopic dermatitis where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications. as many of you are aware, the fda issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for jak inhibitors, including rinvoq in early september. while we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field and we have not observed a significant impact to rinvoq's utilization at this time. that said, should the updated label restrict use to tnf inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in ra.
based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of ra therapy. we do expect that rinvoq will ultimately obtain higher share growth in the second line plus setting as most patients ultimately fail tnf therapies over time. overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of rinvoq and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to abbvie's long-term growth. in hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis.
imbruvica and venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme indications, including cll, where abbvie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. global imbruvica revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. in the u.s., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in cll and as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including venclexta and other btk inhibitors. new patient starts in cll remain below pre-covid levels.
and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong aml launch trajectory in the international markets. in neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25% on an operational basis. i'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including botox therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well.
total sales of $645 million for all the therapeutic botox uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. ubrelvy, our leading oral cgrp treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. total sales of $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. based on ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts, and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that ubrelvy represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity.
and now we are just launching qulipta, the only oral cgrp specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. early feedback from our physicians has been very positive, given qulipta's strong efficacy, safety, and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. the qulipta launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. qulipta also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity.
now we believe having three distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with botox therapeutic, ubrelvy, and qulipta which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position that capture growth in this dynamic market. turning to psychiatry. we also see robust performance with vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical antipsychotic.
total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar one disorder, and bipolar depression. lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $871 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis. mavyret sales were $426 million, up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre-covid levels. and we saw double-digit growth operationally for both creon and lupron.
so overall, i'm pleased with our continued execution across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. and with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d programs. mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both rinvoq and skyrizi across therapeutic areas. following successful completion of the registrational programs for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and skyrizi in crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respective indications. we saw very strong data for both rinvoq and skyrizi as induction and maintenance treatments in uc and crohn's, respectively.
and based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. we anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. earlier this month, we announced positive top-line results from our phase 3 select-axis two program for rinvoq and axial spa, which included data from two stand-alone studies. one for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics and another for patients with non-radiographic axial spa.
in the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, rinvoq performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo. we saw levels of efficacy in this difficult-to-treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. these results will be added to our submission package for rinvoq and as, which is currently under review by the fda. in the non-radiographic axial spa study, rinvoq also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints.
we plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well. rinvoq's safety profile in these axial spa trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of dvt, pe, mace events, or malignancies in either study. based on the data generated in the select access program, we believe rinvoq has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from axial spondyloarthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid, and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. as you're likely aware, in september, the fda communicated that they will require new warnings for jak inhibitors, including rinvoq and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti-tnfs.
we continue to work with the fda regarding updated labeling language for the ra indication while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. we remain confident in our submission packages for these three new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the ra label update. in the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. we're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for venclexta.
in our study in previously untreated higher-risk mds patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include six-month follow-up data for duration of response. based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the fda in the first half of 2022. and for an accelerated approval. we continue to make good progress with venclexta in the canova trial, which is evaluating venclexta in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t114 mutation.
venclexta has shown strong anti-myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and, if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. we expect the data readout from this event-driven trial next year. in our early to mid-stage hemon pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the epcoritamab phase one/two studies in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. and we're evaluating epcoritamab as both a monotherapy and in combinations.
we expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year, and we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. we also recently began the dose-escalation stage of the phase one-b studies for lemzoparlimab in aml, mds, and multiple myeloma. and abbv-383, our bcma cd3 bispecific antibody is currently in the expansion stage of its phase one study in multiple myeloma patients. and we expect to begin registrational phase three studies next year.
moving to neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. in september, we received fda approval for qulipta, the only oral cgrp specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. we're very pleased with the label, which reflects qulipta's strong benefit-risk profile and is supported by a robust clinical development program. in our registrational program, which evaluated qulipta in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with qulipta resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo.
and approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in migraine days. we think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. our migraine portfolio now includes ubrelvy for acute treatment of migraine, qulipta for preventative treatment of episodic migraine, and botox for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. with this distinct portfolio, abbvie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease.
this morning, we announced top-line results from two phases three studies evaluating vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. in the 301 study, the 1.5-milligram vraylar dose met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total madrs score compared to placebo at week six with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. in this study, the three-milligram vraylar dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p value of approximately 0.073 at week six. in the second phase three trial, the 302 study, neither vraylar dose met the primary endpoint of changing total moderate score at week six, but both the 1.5 and three-milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks two and four, with nominal p-values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons.
additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational phase two-b study, where vraylar demonstrated efficacy in mdd when added to ongoing antidepressant treats. based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. we plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to submit our regulatory application to the fda in the first half of next year. we also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase three study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system, abbv-951 to oral levodopa-carbidopa in patients with advanced parkinson's disease.
in this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in on-time without troublesome dyskinesia as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral levodopa-carbidopa. we're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced parkinson's disease. we plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the u.s. and europe in early 2023.
and in eye care. we announced a partnership with regenxbio to develop and commercialize rgx-314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet amd, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal diseases. rgx-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline and complements our eye care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. regenxbio recently presented initial data from two phases two studies evaluating rgx-314 in wet amd and diabetic retinopathy using in-office suprachoroidal delivery.
while early, these results are encouraging with rgx-314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose and the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. also in eye care, we continue to expect approval for beauty shortly, formerly known as agn-190584, and for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. this once-daily eye drop was developed to help address the presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses and once approved, would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, who may not want to wear reading glasses. this has been a very productive year thus far for our r&d organization and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months.
we expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone-filled year for abbvie as well. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. as you have heard from rick, jeff and mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business and support abbvie's long-term financial outlook. turning to third quarter results.
we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, up 17.7%, compared to the prior year and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. this includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year.
this includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 11.4% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense up 20.6% of sales. net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. as rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67, reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint. excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items.
this guidance continues to contemplate full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. at current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% and favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. this implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions.
we now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. we now expect international humira sales of approximately $3.3 billion. for imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting a slower recovery of the cll market. for mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion, and we now expect organic expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion.
as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. finally, abbvie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities.
we generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of september was $12 billion, underscoring our confidence in abbvie's long-term outlook, today, we announced an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in february 2022. and we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year with further deleveraging through 2023. this will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. in closing, abbvie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.
with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. [operator instructions] operator, we'll take the first question.
",2021-Q3,ABBV
0.9793499999999999,,,,":
operator
our first question comes from chris schott with jpmorgan. your line is open.
chris schott -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thanks so much for the questions. i just have a couple here digging into rinvoq in a little bit more detail. i guess, first in rheumatoid arthritis, can you just -- it looks like volumes have plateaued a little bit.
it's probably not hugely surprising given label revision, but just elaborate a little bit more on the feedback you're getting from physicians there and when you anticipate you'll start to see sequential growth again in that indication. the second question i had on rinvoq was then on atopic derm. just elaborate again a little bit more on the ramp you're expecting here. is this something that's going to take some time? or do you view that there's some low-hanging fruit maybe with some of the dupi failures? i'm really just trying to get to with all of these is, i guess, the $2.7 billion guidance, how much of that's ra? how much of it is new indication? just a little bit more color on that front.
thanks so much. 
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. thanks. it's jeff. i'll give you some sense on what's happening with ra.
so the ra market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. so i'll give you some sense, and i'll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the december, january time frame with overall volumes in the market. but right before the drug safety communication, we had about a 16% in-play share in ra, which was just right behind humira. so very, very strong.
if we look at where that's trended over the fourth quarter, it's dropped about 20%, ok? so it's about 14% reported in october, just over 13% in november, very consistent with what we thought would happen. so about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. and what we see from the market is it's exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. so what we're going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after december in the first quarter, we're going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot toward that second line plus.
so the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we've been talking about in terms of overall ra. obviously, psa is going to help build upon that ra dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. so everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. in terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, i said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the label.
we have those stringent end points of the easi 90, the high skin clearance. very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. we obviously have both doses approved. the market, i can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it's very important.
so that's basically -- we're going to start to see that ramp. it won't -- we don't think it's going to be slow. and to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it's happening already. we obviously haven't reported any of the trxs yet, but we can see it in the market.
and typically, it's falling into a couple of areas. first, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there's a reasonably significant number of people after four or five years that just have failed and exited the market. they're going to come back in. we have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren't doing well, in particular with the itch.
we see some early starts there. and then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. so the market seems to be progressing as we expected. it's not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we're going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population.
also, as i mentioned, that we will start to see our access ramp fairly quickly here over the first part of the year. so we're encouraged. maybe i can turn it over to rob to give a sense over the relative magnitude of the sales. 
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, jeff. chris, this is rob. so of the rinvoq guidance of $2.7 billion, the ad and spine indications will each contribute a couple of hundred million dollars, while uc will contribute around $100 million. you need to keep in mind -- in terms of sequential growth, keep in mind, in the u.s., you tend to see from q4 to q1, it's a sequential decline.
so that's just a seasonal dynamic that we see across the business. so you would see sequential growth resume in q2 and beyond.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from ronny gal from bernstein. your line is open.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my questions, and nice quarter. first question is around humira. i was wondering if you guys will be in a position to give us some sort of a floor number in 2023 based on payer contracts. sometimes this year, obviously, the market is looking for that.
and then when i talk to payers, it seems a lot of the decisions about what product they would use longer term will not happen in 2023. that will happen in 2024. you kind of talked about kind of like a decline and then a quick ramp-up. do you see the floor here in 2023? or do you see it in 2024? and then if i could sneak one more.
you have one of the largest differences between gaap and non-gaap earnings in the industry because of that allergan acquisition. as you look at the amortization period and so forth, when do you think this thing will begin to narrow in a significant way just because that's a concern for some investors? 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
 ok. ronny, this is rick gonzalez. i'll take the humira questions. i think if you look at the guidance we provided thus far, i mean, i think that's consistent with how we see the market playing out overall.
we've said basically you should be thinking about 45% erosion, plus or minus 10%, that's probably a reasonable range. nothing has really given us any indication that it should be different than that at this point. i think we will be in a position as we move later on this year to potentially be able to provide some more specificity around that. we should be through all of the contracting at that point, in a better position to be able to understand the ramp and the change that will occur over that period of time, and we certainly want to provide guidance when we have confidence that we can give you a high degree of specificity of what that guidance looks like.
as it relates to your question about will the floor for humira -- i think your question is, what will the floor for humira be in '23 or '24? and i believe you'll see further erosion from '23 to '24 on the humira business alone. but what we have described is we returned to growth on the overall business. so you have to think about it from the perspective of this underlying growth engine that gets suppressed in '23 by the significant erosion that you see around humira, both price and some volume. and then as that continues, it continues at a slower pace when we get into '24.
so the overall business has the ability to be able to drive growth for the total company. but yes, humira would continue to decline in '24. and then rob, why don't you cover the third one? 
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. ronny, this is rob. so when you look at our adjustments to specified intangible amortization, i'd say intangible amortization is like 70% of it. this is on the $4.74 guidance that we've given this year.
and that will continue. obviously, those things fall off over a number of years. but i would say that's probably a level that i would assume would be present for the next several years. another big component is skyrizi contingent consideration given that we're -- that's purchase accounting, and we record that accretion as such.
that will certainly fluctuate over time. but i'd say those are the two biggest components of the guide this year. and certainly, integration costs are starting to wind down. so you would expect to see those come down.
but it is going down from last year. and so you would expect it potentially trend down. but overall, i think you can model this level going forward.
ronny gal -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks. 
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, ronny. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew baum with citi. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions. firstly, on imbruvica. as we move into 2022 and the covid dynamic shakes out, we'll be able to see the impact of competition versus covid.
assuming that a significant chunk of the u.s. slowing growth rate or decline is due to competition, what can be done to recoup the momentum against the narrative, particularly of calquence? and then second, in terms of your aesthetics business, you terminated your contract with medytox in your liquid formulation. there are competitive products coming to market, as well as increasing price competition. how much of that is concerned -- or is your franchise and the breadth of the portfolio enough to minimize any impact of novel formulations? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. it's jeff. so thanks. and you're right that we still have the continuing lingering effect with covid, and rob addressed that in his comments.
so we still see the market versus '19 levels down about 10% and even marginally down from 2020 in q4. so we anticipate that that will moderate go forward. and then we're left to manage the competitive impact. so we are seeing competitive btks have some impact on imbruvica, but we're also seeing the competitive impact from our own venclexta.
so we have to start to think about looking at the combination of the abbvie position, which is still very, very strong. to give you some sense in second line, we have 45% share of the market, and it's even higher in third line, and it's in the 30s for front line. so we have to continue, which is our strategy, to highlight where we have a lot of distinction, which is the strength of our data across every comparator in cll, the overall survival benefit and then also bring the strength of our overall portfolio. so that's how we plan to mitigate it.
as rob mentioned, we see market recovery offset by some share pressure on imbruvica, mitigated by positive ven impact. so that's how we see the market develop as we go into 2022. we also are seeing some pricing pressure in some select segments that are also contributing to the share loss for imbruvica. and obviously, we -- as much as we can, we keep the pricing discipline in the market moving forward.
so i hope that context helps.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hey, andrew. this is rick. i'll cover the aesthetics questions for you. certainly, as you look at botox, both here in the u.s.
and internationally, it competes today against a significant number of competitive alternatives that are available. i think it's a pretty impressive position that botox has in the market. when you look at the brand equity that it has, when you look at the confidence that injectors have in using the product, they tend to describe it as the most forgiving of all the toxins that they have experience with. and then there's obviously a fairly significant customer loyalty aspect to botox with the loyalty programs, and allergan has a very significant loyalty program that offers patients incentives to be able to use the product and to go back and get repeat procedures.
having said all of that, we feel confident in the position that we have competitively against the competitive alternatives that we see out there and those that we see coming. we have a very active r&d effort in the aesthetics r&d group now that's looking at next-generation toxins. two in particular that we highlighted in the comments earlier are we had a short-acting toxin that's in development that's progressing very nicely, and we have a true long-acting toxin that's in development as well. and we believe that those will help grow the market.
but if i look at the market now, obviously, we've seen significant acceleration in the market since we've activated many of the strategies that we put in place after acquiring allergan. but if i look at our overall share, overall share has stayed very steady, in fact, might have ticked up 1 point in the latest set of data. so that tells you that we're not only growing the market very rapidly, but we're continuing to compete quite effectively against the alternatives that are out there. so i'm not overly concerned about what i see on the horizon.
i think we have the opportunity to build the market even larger with some of the next-generation toxins that we're working on when we bring those to the marketplace. so i feel good about our position in toxins and in fillers as we move forward. 
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thank you, andrew. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vamil divan from mizuho securities. your line is open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank so much for taking my questions. so a couple -- i always appreciate all the guidance you guys give, both near term and longer term. just a couple of questions i have related to more of the longer-term guidance you've given.
in the past, you had talked about your hem/onc franchise sort of in peak sales or sales, i guess, in 2025 of around $13 billion. when you updated some of your numbers earlier last month, i don't think you updated that one. so i'm just curious if you still think that that's a reasonable sort of 2025 expectation. and then the other one is around ubrelvy, where you've sort of stayed with this guidance of sort of more than $1 billion in peak sales.
but you're already guiding to $800 million of sales just in this current year pretty early in the launch. so i'm just wondering if you can maybe give a little better sense of how you're viewing sort of the longer-term opportunity for ubrelvy. and maybe if you want to mention qulipta, although i know that's early, but at least for ubrelvy, if you think there's significant upside to that $1 billion number you've mentioned before. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hey, vamil. this is rick. so i'll cover the first one, and then i'm going to have jeff cover the ubrelvy question that you've asked. so it's a good question.
obviously, the hem/onc market, in the areas that we participate in, in particular, i would say, cll, has changed over the last several years. i think one of the -- certainly, one of the things that was not ever anticipated in that guidance was the impact that covid would have on the market and the reduction that we saw in the number of new patients, which was quite sizable and obviously wasn't contemplated in it. and the second thing is we are seeing certainly more competitive pressure, both from price and some volume, than we anticipated in that time frame. having said all of that and -- well, i'd say a third item is, certainly, venclexta is performing well as well.
and i'd say it's tended to exceed some of our expectations, at least at this point, within the launch trajectory of the brand. so all of those have factors in what we're describing here. i'd also say we have done a nice job of building out our hem/onc portfolio from an r&d standpoint. when i look at some of those assets that i described in my opening comments, i think they're going to have a very significant opportunity.
as an example, one that i didn't mention there would be venclexta and the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. that could be a very significant opportunity. we feel good about that. we should get a readout on that.
and we think that could be a significant contributor to both improvement in patient therapy, but also a significant improvement in the overall revenue in the franchise. and then you have things like navitoclax and epcoritamab and 383, those are all significant opportunities to be able to drive growth. so i still feel confident in the overall ability for us to grow our hem/onc franchise. having said that, i would say imbruvica is under more pressure than we anticipated when we put that guidance out.
at that point, we didn't even contemplate follow-on btks in any meaningful way. but we do see more competitive pressure there. but overall, i'd say i still feel very confident in our ability to be able to grow that that it will be a growth franchise for the company over the long term.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. hi, vamil. it's jeff. so just to answer your question on ubrelvy in the overall market.
certainly, we're very pleased, as i mentioned in my remarks, over the momentum on ubrelvy. we continue to lead in that acute space. and the early results for qulipta are also very strong. now a lot of it is going to depend on how that cgrp market develops.
so if you think about it in this way, and this is how we think about it is, it's about -- in terms of new patient capture for the total ubrelvy market, where we also compete with another player from biohaven, it's about 18% to 19% of the market. and the market is also with the expanded triptan market, of course. so if you look at that, the payers certainly like you to step through one or more triptans. when you look at the population that may not be eligible for a triptan or fails a triptan, the estimates are typically up to 30% to 35%.
and so the market has potential room to sort of double into that epidemiology. so you can kind of run the numbers there. i mean we often get the question, is it over $1 billion? is it closer to $1 billion? or is it closer to a higher number? but nonetheless, we're pleased. certainly, it's exceeded our expectations so far, and qulipta has as well.
so i think there's more room for the market to run, but we'll have to see. i mean there are payer pressures in the market, as i mentioned, in terms of the step-through therapy.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, vamil. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve scala from cowen. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. i have a couple of questions. at a high level, i struggle to understand why 2022 won't be a stronger year than the guide on the earnings line. skyrizi and botox are doing phenomenally.
rinvoq is holding its own. humira will still be exclusive in the u.s. for the whole year and should be at peak profitability and the pandemic, less an obstacle. so why won't 2022 look more like or even better than 2021 in terms of earnings power? and secondly, there was no mention of the cf program even in the upcoming milestones.
any thoughts on the timing of the triplet data? in the past, i would describe abbvie confidence as being no more than moderate. has it changed one way or the other? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
hey, steve. this is rick. maybe rob and i will tag-team your first question, and then michael will cover your second question. i think if i look at 2022 and i look at our overall performance coming off of a strong year in 2021, it's pretty impressive performance.
when i look at the eps growth, certainly, do we have an opportunity to drive it harder? i can tell you, every year, we endeavor to drive it as hard as we can drive it. and when i look at all of the businesses individually and i look at their ability to be able to perform, i'm extremely confident in the trajectory that we have going forward. specifically, we're assuming, as an example, in hcv -- that there's still a covid impact in hcv. so i wouldn't say the pandemic is completely gone in 2022.
and -- but i'd say overall, the brands are performing well. we're investing in the business to ensure that we continue to be able to drive long-term performance. and so certainly, that obviously drives some expectations around what the eps growth will be year over year. i don't know, rob, anything you'd like to add?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i mean, i think it's a good point and that we are fully investing to support the long-term growth. if you think about -- we're launching -- ad, that's a new area for us. qulipta and vuity, we're also going to fully invest there. aesthetics, we've seen that -- the strength of the investment in aesthetics, the way we've been able to grow the market.
so that's really important. at the same time, we're expanding operating margin. we're exceeding our expectations for synergies. and so you're seeing us deliver another year of operating margin expansion.
so i'd say we're top tier in operating margin, very healthy p&l profile. and then the other thing that you probably have to factor in here is that we've assumed half-year restasis as well. we don't really have visibility to the generic until we make an assumption every time we update guidance six months out. so that's something that as you look at year over year that you should figure into your comparisons.
but overall, we're very pleased with delivering double-digit growth in earnings and seeing another year of very strong operating margin expansion while fully investing to support the growth of the business.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
and this is mike. i'll take the question on cf. i think it's important to keep in mind that this is a pre proof-of-concept program that doesn't contribute in any meaningful way to our long-term outlook and doesn't factor into our thinking about the long-term potential in the pipeline. and the way we have discussed it is consistent with that view.
we've always said that it represents significant upside if it were to hit, but it's an early program. with respect to the timing of the data, we continue to track toward the timing that we've described previously. we would expect to have data from the triple, sufficient to enable a go/no-go decision later on this quarter.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question, please. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tim anderson with wolfe research. your line is open.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions. i'm guessing that as we move through 2022, investors are going to start to have some concerns about 2023 earnings, what the impact from humira could be, and you talked about having more visibility on humira contracting later this year. my question is, is it possible you'll actually give us 2023 earnings guidance sometime this year, like at q3 results as an example? and then my second question, just going back to cf data.
you said in mid-november that you would actually have that data in-house by the end of the year. so here we are four weeks later, we haven't really seen anything. my question is, do you actually have that data in-house? did you hit that time line of end of year. if not, what's going on? what changed in that short window?
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. tim, this is rick. i'll cover your first question. mike can address the second one.
we certainly are in a position now to be able to commit that we would give earnings guidance in the third quarter. i think clearly, we'll be able to give a better feel for what that erosion curve looks like. and could that ultimately end up being at least a pretty good perspective for us to be able to build off of what earnings guidance would look like? it might. i think if we're in a position where we can confidently provide that guidance, we would provide it.
but i certainly think we'll be in a position where we have very good visibility as to what that erosion curve will look like. and at that point, we can tighten it a bit and be able to provide a higher level of specificity. we understand it's an important issue for investors. as far as eps is concerned, in 2023 -- we have said that we expect eps to decline in 2023.
so i don't think any investor is -- that would be a surprise to any investor. but obviously, it's important for us to be able to frame it as accurately as we can for the investment community and be able to provide direction around that. and at the point at which we think we can do that in a reliable way, we're committed to be able to do that. so let's see how it plays out.
and certainly, as we get to the third quarter call, that would be the position at -- the point at which, i think, we'd be in a position to be able to provide more clarity. mike? 
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so on cf, what we said toward the end of last year is that data would begin to come in-house around the end of the year, and we would have sufficient data to make a go/no-go in the first quarter. and we're still tracking to that overall time line. there were some challenges toward the end of the year, where a number of patients were expected from australia, for example, and australia shut down because of covid and we had to shift that enrollment. so we perhaps have slightly less data than we would have hoped to have had at this point in the year.
but again, we're still tracking to be able to make that go/no-go decision by the end of the year because it's important to keep in mind that these are short studies. and so once you get those patients in, you can turn the data around and make a decision pretty quickly. but the overall timing hasn't changed substantially from what we described at the end of last year.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, tim. operator, next question, please. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mohit bansal from wells fargo. your line is open.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question. congrats on the quarter. maybe a question on rinvoq and other oral competitions in -- competitors in ibd.
where do you see rinvoq fitting versus other orals such as snp inhibitor? i mean now they are more than -- there could be more than one. and kols, i mean, they kind of suggested some kind of induction with one drug and maintenance with other drug, a kind of treatment paradigm in ibd. do you think it is even a possibility in any of these diseases? thank you. 
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
i think if -- this is mike. i'll take that question. if you look at the performance of rinvoq in inflammatory bowel diseases, both in uc where we have the full data set and in crohn's disease, where we have an important component of the induction data set, the performance across the board is very, very strong. not only in terms of just overall response rates that are measured, but particularly when one looks at deeper measures of response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, major clinical response, which is the combination of remission and endoscopic improvement.
and across the board, we're driving very high levels of disease control. and we think that feature of the drug, combined with the overall benefit/risk, position us to compete very effectively against not only oral competitors but many competitors, all competitors in the field. when we look at those data, to our eye, given the limitations of cross-study comparisons, we see response rates that just aren't paralleled in the field. and so we think that there is a very real opportunity for rinvoq, and our view of its role in ibd reflects that.
with respect to mixed induction and maintenance regimens, it's important to keep in mind that there are no data to support those sorts of regimens. all of the programs look at induction, followed by maintenance, which is usually a step-down in dose from the induction dose. and that's the data set that physicians will have. now it's important to keep in mind that in the long term, patients often lose control, and then they need to be reinduced with a new agent.
and one of the very strong features of rinvoq and quite frankly, skyrizi also shares this characteristic, is it has very durable response. so it does maintain response for a very long period of time in the studies that we have continued to follow, including our long-term extensions from phase 2 and our phase 3 program. so we think those are also very strong attributes to the products.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
that's all. thank you very much.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, mohit. operator, next question, please. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gary nachman from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning. aesthetics has been a big source of upside in 2021. so i'm curious, did you see any real impact from omicron in the fourth quarter? do you see a tailwind maybe from that further recovery this year? is that baked into the aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion that you have for 2022? and you've talked about high single-digit long-term aesthetics guidance, but this year should be double digits.
so should we be thinking more along the lines of double-digit growth maybe for the next few years if you're still investing a lot in that space? and then just one other quick one on qulipta for the chronic migraine prevention indication. that data is coming soon sometime this quarter. so just talk about how meaningful you think that indication will be and how that's factored into the peak targets that you talked about. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
gary, it's a good question on omicron in aesthetics because it is something we track very carefully in every major geography around the world, as well as by state here in the united states. and i will tell you that, at least as far as the u.s. is concerned, there has not been much of an impact on aesthetic volume, unlike what we saw when there was an actual shutdown. and obviously, you would think shutdown, you're going to see the volume go down.
but i'd say here, we're seeing very little impact on the volume. so we have factored in that we don't expect a major disruption going forward. and i think the data would clearly support that that's a reasonable position to take. and as far as the business overall, i mean, i can tell you, we're very pleased with how the business is performing.
i think that group is executing at a very high level. and certainly, the resourcing and the dedicated structure that we put in place, i think, are helping a lot in major geographies like the u.s. and china. we're obviously comfortable with the guide that we provided.
it is an area that we're going to continue to invest in and continue to drive. and i think it's a market that, i think, is extremely attractive. and it's going to require both us to continue to execute and invest in it appropriately to grow the market, but also to build out more assets that meet patients' needs to be able to expand the market. and so we've almost doubled the r&d investment that we have in aesthetics since we took it over.
and we have a number of programs that, i think, are very exciting programs. some of the biostimulatory and regenerative fillers that we're working on now, i think, could be exciting opportunities like tropoelastin. to be able to stimulate tropoelastin in patients using fillers is an exciting program that continues to advance. and so it's going to require both.
it's something that we're absolutely committed to continue to drive. and i think this can be -- as we indicated in our comments, i think this can be a strong business for abbvie over the long term. jeff, do you want to cover qulipta?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. thanks, gary, for your question on qulipta. it's an important new indication if we see -- when we see the data and it were to be approved. and i'll give you some perspective.
obviously, we've talked about how much we really like our portfolio of migraine. you got botox on chronic with the injectors. obviously, you have qulipta right now in episodic and, of course, ubrelvy in acute. so the qulipta chronic gives us quite a bit of flexibility, and it's a nice catalyst.
even though episodic is a bigger market in terms of patients, obviously, chronic patients do consume a lot of medication. largely, if you think about the market structure, you've got injectors, meaning they inject botox, or you have noninjectors. so to bring in the first oral that -- for people that don't choose to have a botox-injectable practice, that's quite attractive. and we think it builds in our story over the strength of qulipta first-in-class designed specifically for these indications.
so it's a very nice catalyst if it were to be approved. and so we're anxiously looking forward to that. the other thing i would note, which is further off, and it's obviously something that would have to play out through the studies in mike's organization, was chronic migraine is so difficult that the potential for patients to have combination treatment, so in other words, a botox therapeutic plus a simple oral drug like qulipta, could bring this concept to that segment of the market called migraine freedom where you're really trying to get the headaches down to as low as possible. and so again, it's further off, but it shows you the flexibility that we have as we continue to build out qulipta across our migraine portfolio.
so we're pretty excited about the potential for cm.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, gary. operator, next question, please. 
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoff meacham from bank of america. your line is open.
geoff meacham -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks so much for the question. just had a couple of quick ones for rick or for rob.
the first one is when you look at your our modified 2025 guidance for skyrizi and rinvoq, were there any changes to your assumptions on duration of therapy or the pricing environment? i'm just thinking about the payer landscape with many more biosimilars coming up and what impact that could have on switching or price increases. and then the second question is on the bd front, we've obviously seen valuations come down quite a bit in smid-cap biotech in the past six months. and i know you've usually talked about $2 billion earmarked for bd, but does the current environment make things like bringing new tas or newer technologies in-house more attractive? thanks so much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, geoff. so obviously, when we go through our long-range plan, we consider the various dynamics of the pricing environment. so we factor that into our 2025 guidance.
i would not say that there's really been an assumption change for duration of therapy. but we did -- we certainly took into account the impact of label on ra, ad, and spa, but then that was offset by the stronger performance ous, as well as the stronger ibd data that we saw for rinvoq and just the overall performance of skyrizi in psoriasis. it was all factored into that updated guidance, but we did not make an assumption change for duration of therapy, and we certainly factor in various pricing assumptions as we go through our long-range plan.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and maybe mike and i will tag-team number two. i mean, certainly, as we -- you've seen us pay down debt at a very significant pace. we're continuing to commit to pay down significant debt this year. and we'll certainly be in a position where we could do larger opportunities, if that was something that we desired and we thought it was the right kind of opportunity, as we move forward in '23 and '24.
certainly, the $2 billion that we've allocated has been sufficient to be able to cover the things that we're looking for. mike has responsibility for business development so i think he's probably a little closer to the valuation question. mike?
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
well, what i would say is that valuations have certainly come down, and that brings opportunities into the focus that might previously been outside of that range of $2 billion a year that we had contemplated. and as rick said, as we pay down debt, we have some more flexibility. but we're going to continue to look at bd in the same way that we always have, which is that it is an important component of adding innovation to our pipeline and needs to be coupled with our internal innovation. so we're going to match what's out there.
the innovation we see, the therapeutic areas that are most promising with what's going on in our early pipeline, and use that to make sure that, overall, we have a very strong and very innovative pipeline. and you can see that, for example, in the way that we have built our hem/onc franchise, where we have a nice-blended, internally discovered and partnered programs from venclexta and imbruvica, obviously our lead programs, to the significant programs behind that, things like navitoclax, epcoritamab, 383 and now teliso-v demonstrating extremely strong data in non-small cell lung cancer. so that's a blend of internal and external innovation. and we're going to continue to look at areas in that same way.
and it's principally going to be the fit for our overall situation, the strength of the innovation, and that balance between internal and external innovation that we look at.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, geoff. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from josh schimmer from evercore. your line is open.
josh schimmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks so much for taking my question. first, i'm a little surprised the contingent consideration adjustment is not higher considering your recently revised skyrizi forecast. am i not understanding that line correctly? or should we be expecting a more meaningful revision in the first quarter? and then you mentioned a couple of times the novel biostimulatory dermal fillers you have in the aesthetics pipeline.
can you elaborate on how you expect those to differentiate versus the current offering and whether you expect those to expand the market for fillers? thanks.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so josh, this is rob. i'll take your first question. so we did actually record in q2 of last year additional accretion for higher sales forecast for skyrizi. that was really tied to both our long-range plan, as well as because it's a fair value measure.
you have to take external forecast into account. and obviously, street numbers have moved up as well. we came out with -- publicly with the updated guidance in december, but we already contemplated that in our contingent consideration accretion in q2 of last year. so that's already accounted for.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so on the biostimulatory fillers, i think the way to think about it, there are multiple programs, but i'll talk about two areas specifically. certainly, one of the areas that you want to be able to look at is your ability to be able to stimulate collagen so that your own body can produce collagen to be able to provide support and filling in a specific area that you desire. and there are some products on the market today that provide that. one of the negatives of those products is you don't get the immediate filling effect that you normally get with a filler, where you get physical filling immediately upon the procedure.
you get a little bit of swelling that occurs. so for a very short period of time, you will get what looks to be filling, but then that swelling goes down. and then for a period of time, the patient has to wait in order for them to get the collagen impact, and that takes a significant period of time. so we have a technology in-house that we acquired and we're further developing that combines both physical filling and collagen stimulation in one product.
so you get the immediate filling effect of a normal filler. and then as that starts to resolve over time, you get the collagen impact that's building over that same period of time to provide long-term filling. so i would say that most of these technologies that we're working on are market expansion opportunities. so that's one example.
the second example would be one of the areas that is important for patients is what we describe as skin quality, the smoothness of your skin essentially. and one of the things that provides smoothness of your skin is the elasticity of the skin. so tropoelastin is an example of a product that we have in development that will allow the body to be able to produce more elastin. so you can inject this product and it will provide, we believe, we have to prove this in the clinical studies, that would provide not only some level -- not a dramatic level of filling but an ability to be able to provide elastin formation along those areas and be able to smooth the skin out.
that would clearly be a market expansion opportunity today. there really aren't fillers that do that. they can stretch the skin with the physical filling, but they don't really provide smoothing of the skin. and so those are two examples of what we're working on. 
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, josh. operator, next question, please. 
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris raymond with piper sandler. your line is open.
chris raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey. thanks. just two questions. first, on the migraine franchise, noticed that you have a phase 3 trial looking at qulipta in botox in a combo therapy for migraine -- for chronic migraine prevention.
our doc checks indicate actually growing interest. docs sort of highlight that as proactively -- as something they're interested in. i guess, was this trial in response to that feedback? or maybe just talk about the rationale and how you're looking at combo in this space. and then just a question on a drug that doesn't come up that you just launched, vuity.
presbyopia represents a huge tam. maybe just talk about initial uptake trends. and what is it about this market, i guess, that you're seeing that you're not making a bigger deal out of this launch? thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so this is mike. i'll start with the question on qulipta and botox combo use, and then jeff may want to add and take the second question. with respect to that combination, it really goes back to what jeff said before, this concept of migraine freedom. now if you think about chronic migraine, these are patients who have 15 or more migraine days a month.
that's a migraine every other day, and these are debilitating attacks. so a substantial reduction in that is great. but what patients and physicians are really seeking is an elimination of the migraine so that they can be free to go across their daily lives -- to go about their daily lives. and given the options that are out there today to really get to that level in those most severely affected patients, combination therapy is an obvious place to go, particularly when it's complementary approaches that work through completely different mechanisms.
and so you would expect their effects to be independent and additive. and where you have a treatment like botox, it has a long track record, it's infrequently administered, and has a long duration. so it's that thinking that led to that combination trial. and i do think we would also agree that there is significant interest in treating physicians around these approaches.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. just to add to that that's exactly right, is the -- it's so logical and there's so much unmet need, to mike's point, in chronic migraine with half a month -- sometimes these migraines last for days. and so there's a lot of desperation. and when the thought leaders and the headache specialists see the impact of botox and how simple qulipta is and how strong that is, they go right there.
so i think we are encouraged, as mike mentioned, to sort of see the outcome of those studies for migraine freedom. it would -- if it works, it would be a real advance for patients.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
and so on vuity, you're right, we didn't comment on it on this meeting. we typically wouldn't comment on a product that's of this size. and i mean it's a very interesting product. i think it clearly has a unique fit in the market.
i'll have -- i'll let jeff talk a little bit about the total available market, what we see as far as the size of that market going forward. but the reason we didn't highlight it is, like i said, if we look at what we think peak sales will be here, it's not a product of the magnitude that we would typically highlight.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. and what we see is that there is excitement about vuity. i mean it's different than the -- obviously, the market is basically over-the-counter or prescription eyeglasses or readers, right? so this is the first-ever product that basically is a drop or a reading drop, right? so when we start to break down the data and you take a really, really big market, tens and tens of millions of patients with presbyopia but we also largely see from the clinical study, it really works the best for moderate to severe younger people, not older people. so as we basically make the cuts, it's still a substantial market size, but it's not as large as you might think if you just look at all the presbyopes that are better in the united states.
but nonetheless, it's early days where we have a sales force that's calling on our optometrist, also ophthalmologists. what we see from the early results is significant interest. we haven't started our big consumer push, which will come later in this quarter. it is an older glaucoma product that's been reformulated.
so there's a little bit of learning from the ophthalmologists who really understand glaucoma products. but overall, the early results are it works as anticipated. it works quickly within 15 minutes. it lasts for six to eight hours.
and so again, when we look at the price point, it's not a reimbursed product. it's a cash pay product. we have, to rick's point, fairly modest expectations, and we'll continue to watch the trajectory here over the next quarter or so.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
i think the big assumption that you have to look at here is what is the utilization per month that a patient would actually use it for. i mean, as an example, i keep bugging the guys that i have to go get a prescription for it. now what do i want it for? when i go to a restaurant, i have trouble reading in low light. so i'll use it for that purpose.
and so it's very difficult to come up with the frequency at which it will be used. if it's used at a high frequency, it will obviously be a bigger product. if it's used at a relatively low frequency, it will be a smaller product. so we'll have to see how it plays out.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, we have time for one final question. 
operator
thank you. our final question comes from matthew harrison from morgan stanley. your line is open.
matthew harrison -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great thanks for squeezing me in. i guess two for me, if i may. so first, on epco, could you just comment around your confidence around accelerated approval here in dlbcl and how you're thinking about that opportunity in the near term? and then on vraylar, maybe just comment on what fda conversations are ongoing there and how you're thinking about the potential for an adcom or not. thanks.
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
so on epco -- we have a high degree of confidence in epco overall. it continues to deliver very strong results, high overall response rates, very deep responses, good complete response rates across a number of indications, dlbcl and follicular lymphoma both. with respect to the confidence in accelerated approval for diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, when we look at the data, we think it clearly exceeds the benchmarks of available therapies in highly pretreated refractory patients. so we would think that accelerated approval should be supported by those data.
we'll allow the data to continue to mature from the expansion cohorts and have our final regulatory discussions later on this year to set up that accelerated approval submission. so it certainly is in our planning, and we think it's very supportable based on the data. with respect to confidence in vraylar in mdd, we're confident in that. we've been confident.
we were confident when we saw the data and looked at the strength of those data and looked at the relevant precedents for molecules that have achieved indications, not only in depression, broadly speaking, but in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. we've completed all of the regulatory discussions that we need to have for the submission, and we're planning the submission shortly, as we described in my prepared remarks. in terms of potential for an adcom, it's really too early to comment on that. we typically start to have those conversations with the agency a few months into the review process.
but based on the data and based on the precedence, it's not something that we would anticipate. however, if the agency were to have one, it wouldn't concern us either. we think the data package is very strong and would hold its own.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president, head of investor relations.
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
 good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; michael severino, vice chairman and president; rob michael, vice chairman, finance and commercial operations and chief financial officer; and jeff stewart, executive vice president, chief commercial officer. joining us for the q&a portion of the call is laura schumacher, vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary. before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for allergan. for this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported allergan revenues have been recast to conform to abbvie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of zenpep and viokace. references to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange.
following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick.  
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook. and then jeff, mike, and rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results, and guidance for 2022 in more detail.
our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for abbvie, with results well above our initial expectations. we delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. full year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. these results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience.
i'm extremely pleased with our momentum, and we've entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. we anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. longer term, we remain well-positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. in immunology, skyrizi and rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond.
over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets. at which point, skyrizi and rinvoq will be commercialized across all of humira's major indications plus atopic dermatitis. with the strong performance that we're seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we've demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for skyrizi and rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by humira. in hematological oncology, we've established a leading position with imbruvica and venclexta, which are both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade.
to support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. notable opportunities from our mid- to late-stage oncology pipeline include: navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms; epcoritamab, a potentially best-in-class cd3xcd20 for b-cell malignancies, including dlbcl and follicular lymphoma; abbv-383, our bcma cd3 bispecific, which has the potential to become a best-in-class treatment in multiple myeloma; and teliso-v, our promising c-met adc being studied for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which was recently granted breakthrough therapy designation. in neuroscience, we have a portfolio of compelling and differentiated therapies to support robust long-term growth in migraine, parkinson's disease, and psychiatric conditions. ubrelvy and qulipta are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories in migraine, with each treatment expected to contribute more than $1 billion in peak sales.
vraylar continues to have a significant opportunity with currently approved indications with peak sales expected to approach $4 billion. an approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections. in 951, a potentially transformative improvement to our current treatment options for patients with advanced parkinson's disease with peak sales also anticipated to be more than $1 billion. our leading aesthetics portfolio represents another extremely attractive growth opportunity.
this business is performing well above expectations, delivering full year 2021 sales of more than $5.2 billion, $700 million higher than our initial guidance. abbvie's increased promotional investments are driving accelerated category growth, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration globally. dedicated resources are also focused on delivering new product innovation within aesthetics with several exciting r&d programs internally, including both short-acting and long-acting toxins, as well as novel fillers, with biostimulatory or regenerative features. and we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio.
given this focused investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. lastly, we've developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies, and a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. with the actions that we've taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. following the u.s.
humira loe event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver a high single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. this is a testament to the strength of abbvie's broad and balanced portfolio. in summary, this is an exciting time for our company. we're demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
 thank you, rick. looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. i'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. global humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the u.s., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis.
skyrizi is performing extremely well. global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. skyrizi has now surpassed humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the u.s. psoriasis biological market with share of approximately 20%.
we are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including japan. total in-play share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very strong and now reflects roughly 37% patient share in the u.s., as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. field promotion is now active globally, and early feedback from physicians has been very positive, given skyrizi's demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our psa clinical program.
with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists having both skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain skyrizi's strong momentum. in addition, we are preparing for the launch of skyrizi in crohn's disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both the u.s. and europe anticipated this year. rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth.
global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. prescriptions in ra remain strong, with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the u.s. and nearly 5% across key international markets. we're very pleased with the competitive labels for both psa and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally.
in atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of rinvoq's new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch end points, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and psa in the u.s. we are also preparing for the launches of rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial spa, with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we are making with both rinvoq and skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk-adjusted global sales in 2025.
in hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. venclexta once again delivered robust growth. sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower-than-anticipated market recovery in cll and increased share pressure from newer therapies.
in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both vraylar and botox therapeutic. i'm also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. this includes our two leading oral cgrp therapies: ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis. we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding cgrp segment.
and we also have qulipta, the only oral cgrp treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. the launch is going extremely well. when considering both paid and bridge volume, qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative cgrp class. roughly three months post launch, this is an incredible accomplishment, and it's a testament to qulipta's demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days.
we expect commercial access for qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. in eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from restasis. lastly, mavyret sales were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain suppressed compared to pre-covid levels. overall, i'm very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to mike for additional comments on our r&d programs. mike? 
mike severino -- vice chairman and president, research and development, corporate strategy office, operations and human resources
thank you, jeff. we made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. in immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. we implemented safety and indication updates to our ra label for rinvoq and also received fda approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis, securing strong labels that highlight rinvoq's favorable benefit-risk profile in both new indications.
in atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15- and 30-milligram doses. and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who have not responded well to other systemic agents such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine or biologics. we also have regulatory applications under review for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spa. we expect an fda approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial spa.
in europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial spa in the second half of the year. we're nearing completion of rinvoq's registrational program in crohn's disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for rinvoq. we recently announced positive top-line results from the first phase 3 crohn's induction study, where rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. we expect to see results from the second phase 3 crohn's induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022.
also in immunology, we recently received fda approval for skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. we also have regulatory applications under review for skyrizi in crohn's disease with approval decisions expected in the u.s. next month and in europe later this year.
we've seen impressive results in our crohn's disease program, and we believe skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market where there continues to be considerable unmet need. we're making very good progress with our early stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard of care across our core areas by providing deeper and more durable responses. our anti-tnf steroid adc, abbv-154, is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as ra, pmr, and crohn's disease. we expect to see preliminary data from our phase 2 dose-ranging study in ra in the fourth quarter of this year.
we also expect to see phase 2 proof-of-concept data in pmr and crohn's disease in 2023. in dermatology, our early stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. our rorgamma t inverse agonist, abbv-157, is designed to more effectively inhibit il-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation. we recently began a phase 2 dose-ranging study for 157 in psoriasis.
moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. we recently received an fda breakthrough therapy designation for teliso-v and second-line-plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer based on the encouraging results we've seen to date in our clinical program. treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy are limited to single-agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20% with a median overall survival of less than one year. prognosis for these patients is very poor.
while targeted therapies have been approved by the fda for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients harboring met exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients who exhibit c-met protein overexpression. patients with overexpressed c-met represent about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type egfr, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the u.s. in stage 1 of our phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received teliso-v, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-met. the second stage of the phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line-plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.
we expect to see additional data from this study next year. we also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-met adc, abbv-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both intermediate and high levels of c-met expression. we also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for venclexta, including results from the phase 3 canova trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation, as well as results from our program for venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk mds patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. we plan to submit our regulatory applications to the fda in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in mds and late in '22 or early '23 for multiple myeloma.
both indications represent important expansion opportunities for venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. we are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class cd3xcd20 bispecific across several b-cell malignancies, including diffuse b cell and follicular lymphomas. we'll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the phase 2 expansion cohort in dlbcl, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. we also have a phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory dlbcl, and we plan to initiate several additional phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse b-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and revlimid.
this year, we'll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for abbv-383, both as a monotherapy and in combinations with standard of care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. we believe our bcma cd3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy. we plan to initiate phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. we also continue to make good progress with navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we've seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients.
we expect a phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. we recently completed discussions with the fda and are preparing to submit our application for vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder.
we expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. we've also completed our registration-enabling program for abbv-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced parkinson's disease. in our phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. we remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the u.s.
and europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. and we expect to see phase 3 data for qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both the u.s. and europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. so in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022.
this includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets, as well as proof-of-concept data from several early stage nme programs. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook. rob? 
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mike. abbvie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. the strong results across our portfolio continue to support abbvie's long-term growth outlook. starting with fourth quarter results.
we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. this includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense of 22.2% of sales.
net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. shifting to 2022. our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items.
we expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. this revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. we expect immunology global sales to grow double digits, including u.s.
humira growth of 8%, international humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, skyrizi global sales of $4.4 billion, and rinvoq global sales of $2.7 billion. in hematologic oncology, we expect venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. the imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in cll, offset by share erosion from increased competition. for aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for botox cosmetic and $1.7 billion from juvederm.
for neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including botox therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, ubrelvy sales of $800 million, and qulipta sales up $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. for eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. lastly, we expect mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. looking at the p&l for 2022.
we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of approximately $6.8 billion, and adjusted sg&a expense of approximately $12.7 billion. this guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the allergan acquisition. we are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. we expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-gaap tax rate to be approximately 12.7%, and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021.
turning to the first quarter. we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. this revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: immunology sales of $6.2 billion, hem/onc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million.
we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-gaap tax rate of 12.4%. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. finally, abbvie's strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in skyrizi royalty payments.
this cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. in closing, we are very pleased with abbvie's strong results in 2021. and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term.
with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz. 
liz shea -- vice president and head of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. [operator instructions] operator, we'll take the first question.

operator
thank you. our first question comes from mohit bansal from wells fargo. your line is open.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. and maybe to begin with on imbruvica. so i mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition.
when you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? and do you think it will stabilize over time? and when you look at imbruvica and venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you for the question. so as i mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to calquence.
and obviously, venclexta is also moving there. so we see a couple of things that are taking place. so we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. and then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market.
so it's kind of like a double hit. if we think of this over the short, mid and longer term, what i would say would be this. so in the short term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline, and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other btks and venclexta. and basically, we have flat guidance this year.
and some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. if i think more about the midterm, i think what's important context there is new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of imbruvica. so it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. we're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that.
so we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. and so that's basically how we think about it. to answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, abbvie has quite a strong position. we have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus.
so clearly, venclexta is able to offset, as i commented in my remarks, some of those pressures. so it's very important for abbvie. it's going to be a very big brand over the long term. in the short term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, mohit. operator. next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from terence flynn from morgan stanley. your line is open.
terence flynn -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. i was just wondering, obviously, you guys have been speaking with payers about the humira positioning for 2023. are you willing to give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about that guidance figure that you put out a couple of years ago? any change in thinking there? and then are you able to disclose the cr rate for the recent epcoritamab phase ii trial? just wondering how that factors into the decision about whether to seek accelerated approval here.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so terence, this is rick. i'll take the first for you. and i'm probably going to answer a little broader because i think it is important. i understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible.
and i think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt -- be adopted in the market. if you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact what that adoption rate looks like. one of them is obviously what will humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace. and this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that.
i think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the united states. but that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process. the second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is how will the biosimilars price? we don't know that. obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the u.s., but there's no market exactly like the u.s.
internationally. and so that's a variable. we're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. but that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.
i'd say the third variable is how competitive will these biosimilars be. it's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the u.s. market, but they're not all the same. and how competitive will they be against what is humira today? and what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to humira.
and what i mean by that is interchangeability and a number of other factors are going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. and i'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the u.s. market. there's no market like the united states for humira anywhere around the world.
in the united states, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. there are certainly biosimilar players that are like an abbvie, and i would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. there are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. but i think anybody, any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar.
and we've spent years building the network that we have. we have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on humira. and we've never had a problem supplying the u.s. market.
so i think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. so those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. the guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. i think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide.
later this year, i think some of these variables will be clearer to it. and we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. some will not. pricing will not be clear at that point.
we're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. so i think that's the way to think about these variables. rob, anything you'd add?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so this is rob. i would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about '23 beyond just the humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. we've talked about aesthetics growing high single digits annually over the next decade.
you can get a sense based on jeff's response today and the way to think about imbruvica, in terms of operating margin, i've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to growth very quickly. so we're going to continue to invest in this business. and as i look at street consensus, i see modeling of cuts in sg&a not necessarily reflecting the appropriate operating margin levels. so it's something just to keep in mind.
and then even -- we've talked about the tax rate growing 1 point per year on average. obviously, you saw this year, it only grew 0.2 points. other years, it may go higher. so we've tried to give the street some ideas of the way to think about '23 model in advance of our formal guidance.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
ok. number two, neil?
neil gallagher -- vice president and chief medical officer
this is neil gallagher. i'll take the question regarding epcoritamab. so we recently reported data from the expansion cohort of relapsed or refractory dlbcl patients. we reported an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months.
one thing that's really important to bear in mind is that this is a pretty refractory patient population with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 in a range up to 11 in at the upper end. and importantly, just under 40% of these patients have failed prior therapy with the car-t. overall, the safety profile remains manageable with the vast majority of the cases of crs at class effect with these agents being grade one and two. to directly address your question, we are not yet ready to reveal additional detail about the data.
they will be revealed at a forthcoming medical meeting. and in fact, i was just in contact with the team yesterday, and i know that they're working very diligently to get those data on a podium in a meeting in the very near future.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
ok. thank you, terence. operator we'll take the next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from tim anderson from wolfe research. your line is open.
unknown speaker
hello. thanks for taking the question. this is alice on for tim anderson. a question on rinvoq.
where could in-play market share in atopic eventually get in your view? and are you seeing any switching away from dupixent at all? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you for the question. i'll give you some context. i mentioned that we see roughly in the mid-teens now after about three months, which we're very pleased in and some more flavor on that.
if you think about the hcps and the doctors that prescribe in the u.s. now, you've got about 9,000. those are the dermatologists and some allergists. there's about 3,000 of those physicians that are the big prescribers.
they're very productive. those 3,000 are the ones that are driving skyrizi, for example, or other big brands in psoriasis. so we see after just about three months, we see almost 1,000 doctors that have prescribed rinvoq. and so that's driving that 15%.
some of it depends in terms of where the in-play share ends up, how many of the competitors come in. we're not really sure that baricitinib will come into the market. we'll have to see. we haven't seen much pfizer activity yet.
to give you some sort of international perspective, in the canadian market, we're seeing where there's really just dupi and rinvoq at this point after a couple of quarters, we're seeing a 30% in-play share in canada. so we are, as i mentioned, very, very encouraged with the early adoption. in particular, my comment around how fast once you see the first prescription take place with some of those productive doctors, how fast they go to the second or third. to give you some flavor of what we see in the u.s., and again, the data is early, we see, as expected, the majority of our use so far in that dynamic market are not switches necessarily.
we see about, let's say, one-thirds, believe it or not, that are not even exposed to dupi. and the doctors are saying, look, i've already given another oral systemic, for example, but the itch in the skin is so severe that they're going to go, i'm going to go right and get the relief with rinvoq. and then maybe the other two-thirds, you see dupi partial responders, particularly related to the itch just isn't suppressed as much, and they still have some skin involvement. or there is, as we've highlighted before, a warehouse of dupi nonresponders that has been built up over the last four years.
so that's the behavior that we see. again, i'm very encouraged on the early results, not just in the u.s. but around the world. rinvoq is going to be a real player in this underserved market.
thank you, alice. operator. next question, please.
operator
our next question is from steve scala from cowen. your line is open.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. two questions. first on epcoritamab, the data looks great. could this molecule immediately start taking share from car-t? or do you think physicians will want to see durability data before selecting a bispecific ahead of a cell therapy? so that's the first question.
the second question is, i'm trying to sift through the answer to the humira question just a moment ago. on the one hand, it seems we need to consider that humira could be more resilient in 2023 than expected. on the other hand, the street needs to raise spending assumptions. so would you object to either of those conclusions based on what was stated?
neil gallagher -- vice president and chief medical officer
thanks, steve. this is neil. i'll take the first question on epcoritamab. the fact that we saw such remarkable activity in a patient population that had failed car-t does not imply that the medicine should be positioned after failure of car-t.
i think they are two very different classes of medicines, as you know. car-t has significant challenges with respect to the need for -- to be prior to administration. whereas the safety profile with epcoritamab is extremely manageable. and again, i don't want to repeat what i said earlier on around crs.
so overall, we see a very strong benefit risk profile emerging for the medicine. and therefore, our intention is to move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy initially gain an approval with respect to -- gain approval in refractory dlbcl and after that move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
steve, this is rick. i think rob and i will handle the second question for you. yes. look, i think it's a great question, and we've gotten that question a lot.
what's the erosion going to be in '23? and is it going to be lighter in '23 and therefore, spill more into '24. and i think that's a reasonable question to start to think through. i'd say as i step back and look at it, i would tell you this. look, at the end of the day, it could be lighter in '23.
that would force more of it out into '24. if i look at the business, that's a good thing. we give us higher cash flows in '23 than what we would be projecting now. ultimately, i think there will be a settling out between '23 and '24.
we'll still get to the levels that we have described or at least that we are modeling. and i think the important thing is, look, humira is going to play out over these two-year period of time. what's important to abbvie, though, is what's that underlying growth that's driving the business and is going to sustain the growth on the other side of the loe. that's the critical aspect of it.
the skyrizi, the rinvoqs, our neuroscience pipeline, aesthetics, it's all of those major growth drivers that we have because that growth is going to be suppressed in '23 and somewhat maybe in '24. but as soon as that pressure is off, that's when it reemerge and be able to deliver growth on the other side of it. and so what we're focused on is, obviously, we're going to try to manage the '23-'24 dynamic to the extent that we're able to. but that's not the most critical part for the business.
the most critical part is driving these growth brands and delivering on the pipeline.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
this is rob. what i would add, steve, just to clarify, i mean, we have a business that's going to deliver high single-digit growth during 2025. it doesn't make sense to be cutting investment in '23. and that's what the street consensus is modeling currently.
so we expect to invest in this business, invest in r&d, invest in sg&a to drive that long-term growth. and given how quickly we'll return to that growth, i wouldn't expect us to be cutting investment in '23.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, steve. operator. next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew baum from citi. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. question for jeff. perhaps you could comment on the impact of il-31 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis where we're expecting additional phase ii data, which obviously don't have the jak labeling associated with how you think it's going to impact the market in terms of delaying the onset of jak therapy? and then second for neil, could you talk to how large the commercial potential for venclexta in t(1114) myeloma, which is due to reported phase iii this year? many thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you, andrew. so important question. so the way that we see the market for the other ils, i do think that there will be a segment of conservative dermatologists that will attempt to sequence.
and i think that largely that they'll be disappointed because it seems the newer agents are very, very difficult to distinguish from dupixent. i think certainly, there could be market access dynamics that start to appear with subsequent ils, i think that's something that we will watch and you would want to watch. i think what's, again, maybe not appreciated as we watch the early quarters of performance in europe and the first quarter of performance here in the u.s. is that there's significant amount of early adopters and dermatologists that will go right to a jak inhibitor, as i mentioned.
they're not always sequencing through dupi. and it's because the severity of some of these patients and the level of the clinical involvement is very, very significant. and so we do see what you would call a significant amount of naive use based on the profile of the jak inhibitor. now these are early adopters.
these are people that have already contemplated the risk benefit, and i think that's important. and so the way that we see the market developing is that when physicians would start with dupi, which will be in a significant proportion of patients, it's not clear at all that their next step will be another il that has been approved or will be approved. in fact, we think it's more likely that they will move toward the best jak that can get to these high levels of skin clearance, the ez 90 plus almost no perceived itch. and i think that's the endpoint that this market is going to move toward and rinvoq is the drug that clearly can deliver on that promise.
and so that's how we see the market developing, and that's why we remain encouraged on the early results around the world from what we're seeing with the agent.
neil gallagher -- vice president and chief medical officer
this is neil. with respect to the question on venclexta, venetoclax canova. so the canova study is a study of venetoclax in multiple myeloma patients with a particular translocation, t(1114). we're making extremely good progress with the study, and we fully anticipate having a phase iii data from the study during the course of 2022.
we know from this particular patient population that were included in earlier studies with venclexta that they are explicitly sensitive to treatment with the medicines in various combinations. the prevalence of this population is around 20% of multiple myeloma and multiple myeloma, as you know, is the common of malignancy. so this is a very significant proportion of the multiple myeloma population that could gain benefit from venclexta. and as mentioned, we're looking forward to being able to communicate the phase iii data during the course of 2022.
thanks for the question.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thank you. andrew. operator. next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris schott from j.p. morgan. your line is open.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks very much for the questions. first one for me is just can you elaborate a bit more on rinvoq coverage, both in ad and uc. i guess just trying to get a sense of where we are today and what's the outlook for the next few quarters? and maybe as part of that, it seems like you're seeing some nice uptake in your bridge programs.
can you just comment when you expect we should start to think about those translating over to third-party rxs and that would be maybe more visible to the outside world in terms of how that uptick you're seeing? and then my second question was just on q1 itself. were there any notable either payer adjustments or gross to net issues? i guess humira, for example, it seems like the low single-digit growth was a departure from recent trends. i'm just trying understand a little bit better what happened in the quarter. is there anything we should just be kind of keeping in mind as we consider the q1 results? thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you, chris. it's jeff. so with your first question is -- we're very confident that we are going to get to high levels of paid access for rinvoq and skyrizi's new indications.
so typically, what we'll see based on the approval time line, we'll be ramping up into the -- by the middle of the year up in the high 90s in terms of our access -- for commercial access. so i think that everyone should be confident that, that's where you're going to start to see this bridge program start to fully convert as the months go by into the paid prescription. so typically, that's the timing we're looking at. you're going to see very strong momentum on paid access by -- toward the end of next quarter is what we've guided toward.
so that's the answer to your first question. i think if you think about -- and maybe just to frame the humira question. the humira fundamentals are and the market fundamentals are quite strong. you see the markets are performing nicely.
our market share growth trends, we haven't seen any trend shift. they've been largely stable. there's some sequential decline based on the size of the market and actually our own brand, skyrizi and rinvoq that are playing very strongly into these markets. what i would say is that, in some cases, q1 can be quite unique over the years.
you've got the issue with the plans resetting their deductibles, you've got issues with doctors that have to put in another prior authorization for the year. and so you do see some co-pay and sort of deductible dynamic. but we think that's really a first quarter type of event, and it's largely been very consistent with what we expected. so maybe i don't know, rob, if you want to build on that a little bit.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would just add that if you look back to our guidance for the quarter, and we gave guidance to the therapeutic area level, we pretty much came in line with that guidance. and so we expected this dynamic, and we're also we're not changing our full-year outlook for u.s. humira, 8% growth.
and that, again, will be driven by market driving volume growth. and so -- it's in line with our expectations. i understand street consensus had a different point of view, but we weren't surprised by that.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator. next question, please. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from chris shibutani from goldman sachs. your line is open.
chris shibutani -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning. if i could ask on vraylar, the product, i think you comment expectations for an mdd approval and yet they'll frame it as potential for upside. can you help us understand perhaps some of the potential there? just thinking back to some of the scale of the peak sales opportunity that, that drug was characterized previously, mdd certainly seems as if it's a potential significant opportunity.
thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you for the question. and it is a significant opportunity. so as we highlighted and tom highlighted, the nda has been accepted, and we're confident in the approval.
i think what we said in the past is that just with the base indication. so before we get that approval, i mean, the fda has to still approve it toward the end of the year. we believe that we can ramp toward a $4 billion opportunity. so that would mean our share just in the base indications of a unique profile with the mania, the mix manian depression, the bipolar depression, we moved somewhere up sort of doubling our share penetration.
so right now, we're at about 2.7% trx share. so we we'd really get close to doubling that based on the momentum. and then mdd would build on top of that. and so it's significant.
i mean, the physicians that we've talked to when we show them the profile are very pleased. first, they know vraylar, they like vraylar. they like the strong efficacy, they highlight nonsedating. they highlight at least verbally a brightening effect of the agent, minimal weight gain, metabolic effects.
and so as they think about that, how that would translate to adjunctive mdd, they like that profile. the other piece that we hear is they like the starting dose. they like that starting dose of the 1.5 milligram dose, which is what we believe that ultimately will be approved. we'll have to see.
so easy to start, easy to take, well tolerated. and so to your point, we believe that mdd will offer some upside and acceleration to the brand's momentum when we achieve it.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, chris. operator. next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from vamil divan from mizuho securities. your line is open.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great thanks for taking my questions. just maybe get back to some of what we were just talking about around the pricing in 1q. but i had a couple of questions regarding the migraine franchise. so the ubrelvy scripts from a legacy publicly out third-party data, it looks like the gross to net -- some net pricing is back to where we were in 1q '21.
and just trying to understand if this is just a seasonality of things or 4q to 1q dynamic or maybe there might be something broader where net pricing for these products is going down. and then tied to that, with qulipta, as you mentioned, look, the prescription numbers are pretty good as it builds up here. i'm curious now that you have sort of two products in that market, does that impact how you're thinking about the opportunity, especially from a pricing side or sort of payer negotiation side? is there any thoughts on sort of bundling the two other in any way to present to get even better active than what you have right now? so any thoughts you could share there would be helpful as well.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so vamil, this is rob. i'll take your first question. so when you look at that there is seasonality in this market in the u.s., and so you do see a shift from q4 to q1. if you look at year over year, you'd see that in q4, as you mentioned, q1 year over year is relatively flat.
i would think about it that way for the full year as well. so you do tend to see a suppression in q1 because of plans resetting that dynamic we see in the u.s. market. but then over the course of the rest of the year, you do see higher pricing.
so on average, the way to think about it is price is relatively stable.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
and vamil, it's jeff now. so i think -- look, we are pleased with the ubrelvy momentum. i mean, actually, since we launched qulipta, ubrelvy has accelerated. so we have to -- because we can't see the competitor because you can see the whole thing.
but when we factor nurtec by eight versus 16, and we try to understand the acute dynamic, we can see that we're clearly the market-leading acute cgrp and that's nice to see. the physicians really like ubrelvy, the markets are robust. i think what you're seeing is what rob highlighted in terms of the overall performance. i didn't really fully appreciate your second question in terms of the access, i can give you a broad overview.
obviously, we're seeing great momentum with the brand. much of the brand is still because the access is ramping is still bridged, just like we discussed there with the immunology agent. so we think, again, by the middle of the year, we're going to see commercial access really start to ramp, and you'll see the conversion start to take place. what's nice is that we're confident in that.
we think that our price points and net price or negotiations are going well. and because of its unique profile, as an agent, basically, the strength of the drug is really significant in terms of its performance against episodic migraine. we feel like we're in good shape. and we're going to build on top of that basically 25% in-play share, which is right now at the top of the league table.
so that's how we see it. we're confident in the access ramp.
vamil divan -- mizuho securities -- analyst
maybe just to clarify the second question then just [inaudible] ubrelvy, is there any advantage of another strategy you might have now because you have two approved migraine oral therapies? or is it pretty much similar it would be if you had one or the other?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. it's pretty similar based on the way that the pricing and the different dynamics work on the other cgrp. it's not -- it's just sort of a straight -- it's a straight play on the access there. ok.
thank you so much.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks. operator. our next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from geoff meacham from bank of america. your line is open.
geoff meacham -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. morning. thanks for taking the question. i just had another one on the ini landscape.
rick, when you look at the market disruption that you'll see in '23 and '24, presumably, that's going to have an indirect effect on skyrizi and rinvoq when you think pricing and share. what would you guys view as a win over this period from a new start or switch perspective or a growth perspective is the first question. and the second part of it is, what gives you guys confidence in the market really normalizing after a 2024 period? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
i think as we look at our long-range plan, we don't see or anticipate a dramatic impact. we've provided that 2025 guidance and i think it's reflective of significant growth of skyrizi and rinvoq. if you look at those assets and you look at their clinical performance, they really stand out. and that's what's driving the kind of volume and growth that we're seeing.
and i think you will see obvious price disruption in the humira market from biosimilars. but i don't anticipate that you're going to see that bleed over in a significant way to those other assets. jeff, do you see any differently?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. i don't see, geoff, much difference. i mean if you think of it in some ways, even on -- let's take rinvoq, for example. i mean, you could say, wow, in prior viewpoints, maybe everyone will step behind a biosimilar at some point in the future.
well, one, we didn't think that, that would happen wide scale as the market develops anyway. but even if it did, our label is already behind a tnf. and so when you look at the level of efficacy that rinvoq's bringing in those later lines, i mean it's -- we're really quite insulated from that, i would put forth. and second skyrizi is just -- is a phenomenal asset.
i mean the level of performance and what it's doing to transform certainly psoriasis today, psa right now and what we think will happen with crohn's and ultimately, ibd, when you look at the level of healing and sort of restating that standard of care, we think the assets themselves are quite well positioned for the middle part of the decade, and that sort of goes to the elements of the planning that rick talked about.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, jeff. operator. next question, please.
operator
our next question comes from gary nachman from bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, thanks. first, just following on that last response. can you talk more broadly about how you see the expansion of rinvoq and skyrizi into the ibd indication? so how is the initial launch for rinvoq for ulcerative colitis going? i know it's early days, but what's the outlook there given physician receptivity around the product? are physicians saying they're excited to have rinvoq for crohn's as well? and also, how do you see skyrizi fitting in with crohn's versus rinvoq? and then secondly, on aesthetics, it was strong in the first quarter, but did you see any impact in the early part of 1q from omicron? and what have the trends been more recently in march and april in the aesthetics business?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you for the question. it's jeff again. so we are very, very encouraged by the ibd momentum that we can build.
and we're right on the cusp of it. and to give some sense is basically this market -- the market of crohn's and you see that -- it actually has fairly high biologic penetration. when we do our research and our engagement with the physicians, what they typically have done for more than a decade since the availability of remicade and then humira, they really hang on as much as possible to their first-line use. they try to intensify, they do all sorts of things because it's quite scary for the physicians and the patients because no one set a different standard of care.
so when you start to look at the healing rates that we start to see with rinvoq in uc, the healing of the bowel, the remission rate, the combination of what we can see, this market looks very, very good to have both of those assets come in with higher standards of care. so we're very, very encouraged, and we think that the ibd market is probably underappreciated in terms of what that looks like. and the patients are so challenged with their disease because it's quite severe with the bowel preparations, the hospitalizations, all of these things, having two assets is a great thing to bring to the market. certainly, in the u.s., it's likely we see that with uc today that you're going to have later line use based on the labeling.
skyrizi is not going to have that limitation. so you can imagine that you have an ability to co-position to sequence appropriately, to think about how you bring that whole portfolio around the world, and that's how we see it. we're quite encouraged that we would have both rinvoq for crohn's and rinvoq for skyrizi in the market. and it's kind of very similar to my comments i made on what's happening with psa today in rheumatology, where both of those assets rinvoq for psa and skyrizi psa are in the market together working as a portfolio.
to get to your first point, it's been only a month or so with our uc launch, but the physicians gastros are very encouraged with the profile. they've not seen the level of remission or the level of healing before in any asset. so there's quite a wow reaction to the efficacy profile. they realize that they have to think about, i've got to think through my patients that are not doing well on tnf or have cycled through a tnf and are struggling.
and i mentioned that's a pretty large addressable population. it's at least 50% of the market today. so early qualitative results are quite strong. and the bridge results are also quite strong.
so we're pleased with the gastro launches thus far.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
carrie?
carrie strom -- senior vice president, abbvie, and president, global allergan aesthetics
gary, this is carrie strom, president of global allergen aesthetics, and i'll take your question about the aesthetics market. and in q1, we did see u.s. toxin and filler markets, both growing in the mid-20s percent. and we expect that sort of growth to continue for the rest of 2022.
and the way to think about it is similar amount of absolute volume growth as '21, but of course, off of a larger base. and in terms of what's driving that market growth, we're seeing very strong demand trends supported by our increased commercial investments, for example, increased consumer activation for acquisition and retention, field force expansions in key markets. and we see these trends also supported just by fundamentals and aesthetics that will continue in the long term. people think about aesthetics more like health and wellness.
it's been much more destigmatized, and we see factors like social media and word of mouth continuing to drive aesthetics in the future. your question around the pandemic, i would say that we are seeing an impact right now in china, and we anticipate that this recent surge of covid cases in china which has resulted in lockdowns across several major cities, has reduced patient traffic into aesthetic offices in china. and china is a top market for aesthetics. so we expect this to impact our near-term international performance for both toxins and fillers.
i should also mention that russia is a key market for fillers globally. and as the tragic events in the ukraine have unfolded, we have suspended operations for our aesthetics business in russia. so although absolute aesthetic sales in russia are modest, like i said, russia is among one of the largest filler markets in the world. so we expect to see an impact on our filler performance in coming quarters.
but despite these dynamics, we do not need to change our total guidance for aesthetics. so we see our continued robust toxin performance in the u.s. to offset this anticipated transitory impact in both china and russia.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, gary. operator. next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robyn karnauskas from truist securities. your line is open.
robyn karnauskas -- truist securities -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. so for epcoritamab, i just have a question on approval. given the recent fda discussion around the pi3 kinase class and sort of hinting that they want controlled data for accelerated approval, how do you view that in light of that panel, the likelihood of accelerated approval? and then second, just a little bit more questions around the bridge program.
i think you said that you're going to expect more payment reimbursement coming online in the middle of the year. just talk to me how long people stay in the bridge program and how you expect that bridge program to continue? and what -- how many people might continue to use it after payers and online. thanks.
neil gallagher -- vice president and chief medical officer
hey, robyn. it's neil. i'll start off with the question around epcoritamab, but maybe just a comment -- a general comment on accelerated approval overall. i think as we're all aware, it prompted your question that the agencies in the course of -- in the process of updating its guidance with respect to accelerated approval.
we haven't seen the totality of that guidance, but we anticipate hearing more from them during the course of '22. as i alluded to, and i'm not going to repeat what i said earlier on about the epco data, but we are extremely pleased with how the molecule is performing, and it is our intent to engage with the agency based on the data that we've toplined recently. it is our intent to engage with the agency in a conversation to explore a path to accelerated approval. and likewise, with some of our other programs, we recently got a btd designation for teliso-v.
for example, earlier this year with a 54% response rate in c-met high non-small-cell lung cancer. again, it is our intent when we have data that are these strong to continue to engage with the agency on those programs to explore potential costs to accelerated approval. so thanks for the question.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
ok. it's jeff. just to comment on your bridge question. thank you for that.
so the bridge transition will be very efficient. so what i mean by that is because of the connections that we have with the payers and our specialty pharmacy network, we're able to -- once access is achieved rapidly and appropriately transition patients from the bridge to basically their paid pharmacy in their prescription. so there's not going to be lingering bridge effects, particularly in the immunology space. so once it starts to move and that access ramps, the bridge transition is quite fast.
and that can be within weeks or a month. and we know that that's the case because we have the model from our earlier launches from skyrizi and rinvoq. so ultimately, once you start to achieve those high levels of access, bridge programs drop very, very fast, and the vast majority, the very vast majority is paid prescriptions. so it's very efficient, and i hope that helps.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, robyn. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
our final question comes from josh schimmer from evercore isi. your line is open.
josh schimmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thanks for putting me in. and congrats to both mike and tom. for skyrizi, did your long-term outlook improve again? or am i misunderstanding the contingent consideration line item?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so josh, it's rob. if you look at the continued consideration, actually, it's a fair value liability, it went down this quarter because of discount rate. so we always have to pay attention to discount rate movement. so we saw the average discount rate increase by about 130 basis points.
you're seeing, obviously, as rising interest rates are taking hold of the market. that's something we have to take into account because we had to mark this to market every quarter. if you look at our release, we had a similar -- we had a decrease last year as well. again, we had discount rates increase in q1 of last year, albeit to a lesser extent.
so that's what you're seeing is just really the discount rate movement. no other real fundamental changes to the valuation of that liability.
josh schimmer -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thanks for clarifying.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
well, thank you, josh. that concludes today's conference call. if you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. thanks again for joining us.

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] today's conference is being recorded. if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president, head of investor relations.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; rob michael, vice chairman, finance and commercial operations and chief financial officer; jeff stewart, executive vice president, chief commercial officer; and tom hudson, senior vice president, r&d and chief scientific officer. joining us for the q&a portion of the call are carrie strom, senior vice president and president, global allergan aesthetics; neil gallagher, vice president and chief medical officer; and roopal thakkar, vice president, global regulatory affairs. before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on their website. following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then jeff, tom and rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. i'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022.
it further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. these results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from skyrizi, rinvoq, neuroscience and aesthetics.
skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. we are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long term. rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth.
subscription trends in ra have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. the early launch trends for rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. we anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent u.s. approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for rinvoq over the long term.
neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. in migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with ubrelvy, qulipta and botox therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. with the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies.
aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. the category continues to grow robust double digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. in summary, this is an exciting time for abbvie, and i'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio.
we're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for abbvie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. we're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. i'd now like to take a brief moment to thank mike severino for his contributions to the success of abbvie over the last eight years. as you know, mike has decided to leave abbvie at the end of may to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best.
i'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you tom hudson. tom joined abbvie back in 2016 as the head of discovery and early development. in 2018, tom undertook responsibilities for abbvie's entire discovery organization. then in 2019, was promoted to the head of abbvie r&d and chief scientific officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of abbvie's r&d.
tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. his medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the whitehead institute and mit, where tom led the team that mapped the human genome. tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome.
tom went on to further lead the ontario institute for cancer research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. but first, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. we continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. i'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the u.s., offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.
skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. in psoriasis, skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the u.s. biologic market.
skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the u.s. and a clear no.1 leadership position. skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. while we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication.
in the dermatology segment, skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the u.s. internationally, skyrizi psa is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of skyrizi in crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year. turning now to rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth.
as anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the u.s., with in-play market share currently 12% in ra. we expect growth in the second line plus ra setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important phase iii trials. first, select-choice, which demonstrated rinvoq's superiority versus orencia across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated ra patients. and second, the open-label extension of select-compare which demonstrated that many ra patients with an inadequate response to humira are able to achieve remission after switching to rinvoq.
early feedback suggests this updated rinvoq ra messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. internationally, rinvoq share continues to ramp in ra with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. we are also making excellent progress with rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis. managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months.
as we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our bridge program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. as a reminder, the volume from our bridge program is not captured in third-party prescription data. i'll start with atopic dermatitis.
we are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. when you include prescriptions from our bridge program, rinvoq total in-play ad share is already in the mid-teens. so we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. as an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated ad market.
in psa, we are seeing a nice uptake in rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the room segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. and importantly, we have also launched skyrizi in the room psa segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of psa patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. we have also launched our first indication in the ibd segment, rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. nearly 50% of uc patients are currently on or have used tnf therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial.
given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for uc patients and physicians. turning now to hematologic oncology. global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%.
there are two factors impacting our imbruvica results. first, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other btk inhibitors, as well as our own venclexta. second, we continue to see higher-than-expected covid suppression on new patient starts in cll, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total btk treated patient market. our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out given the continued impact from recent covid variant.
despite these dynamics, imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across cll and several other major blood cancers. based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for imbruvica, showing sustained disease control, as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for abbvie over the long term. venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing imbruvica. global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis.
in the u.s., venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline aml among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus pll. we are also seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance across all approved indications. additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our heme on portfolio with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for b-cell malignancies, navitoclax for myelofibrosis and abbv-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support expected to support sustainable long-term growth. turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from vraylar, botox therapeutic and ubrelvy.
ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral cgrp treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the u.s. preventative cgrp class when we consider both paid and bridge volume.
we expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the u.s. as well as to support regulatory applications across the international markets. this indication, if approved, will provide added differentiation for qulipta as the only oral cgrp therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine.
in our other notable therapeutics, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for restasis unfavorably impacting our results. mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-covid levels. so overall, i'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. we remain on track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to tom for additional comments on our r&d program. tom?
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology. we recently received fda approval for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and drillable remission. in our uc development program, rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in phase iii studies.
importantly, rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. our regulatory applications for rinvoq in uc remain under review in europe and japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive top line results from the second phase iii induction study for rinvoq in chron's disease.
similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. we expect to see results from the phase iii maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for rinvoq and crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. rounding out rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spa. we expect an fda approval decision in the second quarter for as and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial spa.
moving to skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for crohn's disease in the u.s. following an fda request for additional information primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer skyrizi. after responding to the agency's request, we received a three-month extension of our skyrizi submission in crohn's disease. we remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for skyrizi in crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in june.
moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. we recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the phase ii study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive b-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. these results are particularly encouraging given that nearly 40% of patients had failed car-t therapy.
we plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. we continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for venclexta and remain on track to see results from the phase iii canova trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t1114 mutation in the second half of this year. in our venclexta mds program, based on feedback from the fda, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing phase iii program. venclexta remains under breakthrough therapy designation for mds and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for venclexta in this indication.
we expect data readout from the phase iii study and our regulatory submission for mds in 2024. in neuroscience, the fda recently accepted our application for vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders. in the area of migraine, we recently reported positive top line results from a phase iii study evaluating qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine.
qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine. this summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the fda for qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our phase iii studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the u.s. in our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a phase ii proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. the results -- the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development.
this study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period with a dual combination therapy containing our c1 corrector and potentiator followed by a 28-day treatment period with a triple combination, which included the addition of our c2 corrector, abbv-119. this allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our c2 corrector. the results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in fev1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. during the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy.
so based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our cf program. we have an additional c2 corrector, abbv-576 in phase i studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing c1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous c2 corrector 119 and has a better pk profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. our plan is to begin a phase ii study for this new triple combo by early next year.
and in aesthetics, we recently began the phase iii program for our short-acting toxin in gabelo lines. this novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. we expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. so in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022.
with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom. abbvie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from skyrizi, rinvoq, venclexta, neuroscience and aesthetics. we also continue to deliver strong p&l performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion while fully funding the business for long-term growth. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3%, compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint.
this includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired ipr&d expense that was not factored into our original guidance. total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for restasis. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year.
this includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired ipr&d expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense of 21.1% of sales. net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. turning to our financial outlook. we are updating our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired ipr&d expense that was incurred during the first quarter.
as a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. this earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. we now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth.
this revenue guidance includes updated restasis sales of approximately $400 million. moving to the p&l. we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted sg&a expense of $12.5 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. turning to the second quarter.
we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. this guidance does not include acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred in the quarter.
in closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. we are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in abbvie's long-term growth outlook. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. [operator instructions] operator, we'll take the first question, please.
",2022-Q1,ABBV
,,,,":
operator
our first question is andrew baum, citi. your line is open.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
first question is on the guidance range you've given for anticipated trajectory of humira in the u.s., presumably you're finishing contracting, both with medicare and commercial. could you provide any guidance further on '23 and even '24 [inaudible] contracts? and then second, a pipeline question in relation to your anti-garp monoclonal, which you've taken a long time to sort of optimize or move forward. i'm just curious whether you're using any molecular markers in order to minimize risk given the failures of other tgf-beta targeted agents, particularly in colorectal using cms 4 or a subgroup of the total population, or are you putting it in all comers, the suggestion that what's an all comers or is this again informed biomarkers? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. andrew, this is rick. thank you for the questions. i'll cover the first one, and then tom can cover the second one.
so, we are in the process now, as we've indicated before, of negotiating with the managed care organizations and the pbms to establish our contract position for humira in 2023. this is a normal time that you would go through that. it is progressing as we would expect. i would say we're midway through that process right now.
i would expect it to conclude near the end of the third quarter, early the fourth quarter. at that point, that's an important part of refining our model for 2023 in particular. and what that will tell us is that the positions that we have formulary status for 2023 in for humira, and that will help us define clearly the volume aspect of it. and so, that's going well, and that's going to be an important part of us being able to refine that model.
and so, as we get further along in that process, that will give us the ability to be able to potentially refine the model that we have. now, the one thing that's important to remember in all of this is price is the other key aspect here. and there, we won't know real pricing until the actual event starts to occur. so, we will make assumptions around what that price looks like.
and i think those will be informed assumptions, but they are just that they're assumptions. and so, that's the one piece that will still be somewhat of an unknown until we see the landscape start to play out in 2023. and particularly in midway through 2023 when more biosimilars enter the market. so, as we get more information and we can provide more clarity, we'll certainly try to do that, but i think that's where we are right now.
tom?
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
thank you. andrew, i'll try to break down the question in different parts because you're right, there are many tgf-beta assets. this one is unique, garp. most of the tgf-beta assets work either antibodies against receptors to be active for tgf-beta or tgf-beta itself that's in circulation on cells.
but garp blocks the inactive form of tgf-beta before it's released from tgf-beta. and we believe that actually is a differentiated mechanism, also allows that specificity to what's happening in tgf-beta in the tumor as opposed to other systems in the body. at the beginning of this, we thought -- we had already had people that published that they are very good tgf-beta signatures that exist. and i can tell you that garp signature follows tracks with tgf-beta signatures.
and that's often seen in all solid tumors as susceptive tumors that express these pathways. it's a very common immunosuppressive mechanism. that's why people and us are interested in it. we learned -- initially, from data, we kind of suspected that people who actually had a nice hot tumors but were not responding to pd-1, often had, at least from published work -- actually had a higher tgf-beta signature.
so, we thought that was a reason to mechanism why these patients with hot tumors were not responding. and a lot of our initial clinical strategy there was actually to go after hot tumors where pd-1s had relapsed or refractory. and we thought we could augment the pd-1 checkpoint response by doing this combination. we did not see monotherapy activity, but in combination, we did.
and that's why our first data sets and expansions like i've just discussed in urothelial cancer, this project started earlier, we're seeing data that's suggesting that this is correct that you need to reflect both the pathway of tgf-beta and pd-1, to get a response. and those, again, in multiple tumor types we're seeing these responses and we're moving forward. at the same time, to bring it to colon, we could also see the same signatures of tgf-beta and garp in cold tumors, but we weren't sure that since they're not io responsive, whether we'd get a response, we would get a clinical response. so, we did start some investigations.
and yes, we did see some responses in cold tumors. they happen over time, sometimes they appear, the tumors are stable for three months, maybe six months. and then you see these responses appear. they're very durable one year, two year, very unusual.
these are patients with advanced disease that have very poor prognosis in phase 1 studies. so, we saw some, i would say -- we sometimes say in academic column exceptional responders. and so, we decided to expand. so, those data sets are newer, are happening right now.
i probably will have the data at the end of this year. but yes, we've seen responses to this combination. and to answer your question, so the signatures we're looking at are not the cms or kind of histology-based signatures on the tumor. it's more signatures of the inflammatory response that we can measure in the tumor, and it has to do with both, inflammatory t cells, which are there for the killing, but also the inhibitory tgf-beta signatures.
and of course, we're going to continue to investigate this. i don't have all the answers for you today, but it certainly has been exciting to see how this program has evolved.

our next question is terence flynn with morgan stanley.
terence flynn -- morgan stanley -- analyst
maybe two for me. just wanted to make sure that you are maintaining your 2022 aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion. rob, i didn't hear you call it out, so i'm assuming that was a reiteration, just given what you're seeing with juvederm in the u.s. and then the second question i had relates more of a, i guess, strategic one, rick.
i know you're still going through the conversations with 2023 for humira. but, as you think about providing an update to guidance, whether that happens with the 3q results or with the 4q results, do you think you'll be able to provide some outlook on 2024 because i think something investors are discussing now is just if the possibility of the impact is more in '24, how we should think about revenue margins in '24 versus '23. so, just wondering strategically how you're thinking about that at this point, not asking for guidance, more just thought process.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
so, terence, i'll take both of those questions, and then rob can certainly jump in here if he has something he wants to add. we are maintaining the aesthetic guidance as we've indicated. certainly, we have seen good, strong performance on the toxin side of the business, and we would expect it to continue. as we look at the filler side of the business, as you've noted, it was lighter this quarter than we've seen historically.
and i'd say that was driven by a couple of issues. it was certainly driven by the china- russia issue outside the u.s. in the u.s., we did have a very successful promotional program that we ran last year. so, it was a tough comparison versus last year.
but i'd also say, we have seen some glimpses of what could be inflationary pressure on that business or it could be pent-up demand for vacations. and carrie can certainly go through more detail if there's a follow-up question. but i think as we look at the business overall, we're comfortable maintaining the guidance now. we believe that botox will continue to perform very well.
and obviously, we're doing more things to be able to drive the toxin side of the business. it's at a price point where it should be less sensitive to inflationary pressures. the price point for toxin is about $500, i think, right, gary? and where fillers are almost twice that or maybe even a little more than twice that. so clearly, from a disposable income standpoint, fillers are more challenging for people than toxins are.
and so that's the rationale behind it. and certainly, as we look at the overall performance of the abbvie business, we have plenty of opportunities with the diversity of our portfolio to cover any potential shortfall if we ended up having an issue. so, that's why we're comfortable maintaining the guidance. and i think we need to see more time play out here to see exactly where we are from a u.s. inflationary impact.
on the second question, as it relates to an update on '23 and potentially something on '24. i think the way you've described it is accurate. when we have more information, we'll try to provide that. and when we've gotten to a point that certainly by the fourth quarter call, we're going to provide you guidance on what we think will happen in 2023.
but if we can provide something on the third quarter call, i wouldn't be looking for guidance. i think that's not a good expectation. but certainly, potentially a little more clarification on what our contracting status looks like at that point and how that will translate into what we think. and if we can refine the model to a greater degree, we would certainly provide that.
as it relates to 2024, certainly, i'm not going to -- we're not in a position we're going to talk about 2024 right now. and i think that would be a little bit unlikely because not all these contracts will be two-year contracts. and so, you really won't know what your volume position is at that point. and as i said, you won't know what the pricing is going to be, particularly midway through the year.
and so, i think those will be important things to be able to dial in to where the forecast is going. i'd say, overall, we feel good about the contracting position that we're in. and then, i'd say, the other thing is, i know investors really want to try to model this between '23 and '24. i understand why you want to do that.
certainly, we obviously would like to do that to the greatest degree possible. but, when you step back and you actually look at the performance of abbvie and how you will value abbvie and what abbvie means going forward, it has relatively little to do with humira, and that shape of that curve between '23 and '24. and certainly, by the end of '24, we should reach a point where we've achieved some level of stability on the tail of humira. what abbvie is all about is these other products like skyrizi and rinvoq and vraylar and ubrelvy, the aesthetics business, qulipta.
those are going to be the things that drive it. so, if you want to focus on something and it's what we focus on internally is that underlying growth engine that will emerge on the other side of whatever erosion humira ends up suffering before it hit some level of stability and tail is those assets and then what comes out of the pipeline. those are the key things that are going to create that growth between 25% and 30%. and that's the part that we -- i would say, we're obviously managing humira to the greatest extent we can.
but that's the part that we as a team are focusing on. and i think that's the most important part because that is the abbvie going forward.

our next question is mohit bansal with wells fargo.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
maybe dwelling a little bit more on the humira question for rick and jeff. so, you said that pricing from the competition will be key unknown for next year. as you get into contracts this year, for the next year, how rigid or flexible these contracts are from the pricing point of view when pbms realize that the biosimilar is giving an x or y pricing, or would that be more of a 2024 issue rather than 2023? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
well, let me take a shot at that, and certainly, jeff is closer to it. so, jeff, if you want to add anything in, feel free to jump in and add. typically, when you contract for an asset like humira, you're contracting for a formulary position. and there aren't volume requirements or other kinds of requirements.
i think it's also -- it would be prudent to assume that biosimilars will be on these contracts, whether it's one or more than one that will coexist with humira. so, price plays an important role in that because they will coexist. and so, i'd say -- and as that becomes fluid, you would have to make decisions around how you try to deal with that to maintain the kinds of volumes that you want to maintain. and we've said all along, the strategy that we'll have in the u.s.
is similar to the strategy that we had internationally, and that is maintain as much volume as we can at the highest level of profit that we can maintain it at. and that is the logic that we will employ. but that doesn't mean we won't have to be somewhat responsive to prices in the marketplace on humira. jeff, anything you'd add?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
no, i think that's -- rick, that's a very reasonable way to look at it in terms of how these negotiations are going and how we see '23 playing out. i mean, the real big ones in terms of how we look at it is the two big scenarios are you are likely coexisting with one or more biosimilars or if the negotiations don't go the way that we anticipate that were excluded in favor of biosimilars. and that's basically where price and volume -- in terms of refining our model, for '23. that's the work that we're doing over the summer and then into the fall.
operator
next question is gary nachman with bmo capital markets.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so, skyrizi was very strong in the second quarter, and you raised guidance nicely. how much of a benefit are you getting from the psoriatic arthritis indication thus far? what are you expecting crohn's to contribute this year? how much are those playing into the raised guidance? and are you revisiting the long-term guidance on skyrizi at this point, given the strong performance? and then just on the hem/onc franchise. are you keeping the infrastructure intact preparing for new products to contribute? and maybe you could talk about the near-term opportunities you see for products like epcoritamab and navitoclax, how much of those could contribute and potentially offset some of the pressure you've been seeing from imbruvica? thanks.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
yes. thank you. it's jeff. thanks for the question.
so, your instinct and observation is right. the big dynamic change for skyrizi here, largely what you're seeing is from the psoriatic arthritis indication. and obviously saw very, very large sequential moves. and let me give you some sense of what we're looking at.
so, we're seeing that we're putting more and more basically headroom into the overall share position, first in psoriatic disease, so that's psoriasis plus psa. so, we're at 26% in terms of total trx share and moving very, very nicely up. so, that's being driven by this psa acceleration. so first, remember that the psa indication, we were the -- really the last large product that didn't have that indication.
so first, what happens is it starts to interact very positively in the dermatology segment. so, as i mentioned, about 30% of patients both have skin and joint involvement. and so we actually had a lower despite the fact that we had the leading psoriasis share, we had a lower psoriasis share because we weren't covered with the joints with that indication. so, you see an immediate, very rapid acceleration of our overall derm business that i highlighted.
secondly, strategically important to the performance is that we're able to launch the psa indication for skyrizi in rheumatology. so, it starts to work together with the rinvoq psa indication, and the rheum segment is three times as large as the derm segment. so, it's a very, very good dynamic in terms of our momentum in two large segments, even before we get to crohn's. now, i would say that as we've talked about before, i mean, skyrizi is a very special product, very unique dosing, very stable, incredible efficacy.
and so, we are encouraged on the early results of crohn's. it's too early to start to see numbers or etc. but all of that is playing into the raise that rob talked about.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and gary, this is rob. just on the guidance. so, if you recall, earlier in the year, we got asked the question, i said psa for skyrizi was going to contribute about $200 million this year. it's probably closer to $400 million now with the guidance range, given the very nice uptick we've seen in psa.
but part of that guidance raise is also the strong share performance in psoriasis. so, it includes both. in terms of crohn's, that hasn't changed. we've set approximately $100 million this year as we ramp access for crohn's.
but obviously, the long-term potential for it is tremendous, and we're very excited about that.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
and maybe i can also then chime in on the second question. certainly, that is a -- the new assets are a very important part of our growth story for hem/onc. certainly, as i mentioned, we're still continuing to ramp around the world with cll. we have more and more impressive data, particularly in the unfit frontline population.
we have five years of data in the fit population for frontline for venclexta. we're encouraged with the myeloma data, which is very unique in terms of biomarker driven approach for the (11;14). navitoclax would be really one of the first new entrants for myelofibrosis, where there's really only been rocks in terms of that market. epcoritamab, increasingly encouraging data in terms of the simple subcu, very rapid ways to get this medication in later lines and then building into frontline.
so we are very, very encouraged while we see some pressure on imbruvica, the new indications in base for venclexta helps to offset that. and then we start to build with those near-term hem assets and super encouraged in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the probability that we can get there.

our next question is from chris schott j.p. morgan.
chris schott -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
first one, i just wanted to come back to dynamics on the u.s. dermal filler market. i guess specifically, can you just quantify how much of the weakness we saw this -- or the decline year over year was due to the promotion events last year versus the impact from the economic pressures that you're seeing? and i guess, in the same context, are you seeing any signs of weakness in the european business? i'm just -- and what i was just trying get your hands around, what type of magnitude of impact you're talking about here in terms of either of its inflation or economic sensitivity to that business. my second question was just thinking about rinvoq and skyrizi formulary and pricing dynamics going forward as biosimilar humira enters the market.
i guess, are you expecting or are you hearing through discussions, any major shifts in the way payers are thinking about those products as we think about pricing coming down and obviously the largest kind of product in the space there.
carrie strom -- senior vice president, abbvie, and president, global allergan aesthetics
hi. this is carrie. i'll take your first question around juvederm. and as rick said, there was a one-time promotional event that we ran in the u.s.
for juvederm in q2 of last year, and it was highly successful, and it increased sales in the sales space, which created the challenging prior-year comparison. so, that was the key driver. but as you noted, there is also this impact -- economic impact that is suggestive of some early changes in consumer behavior. and that really isn't surprising in light of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing on discretionary income.
and as rick said, the filler market is likely more sensitive to that than toxins for a few reasons. we mentioned the price point. so a price point of closer to $1,000 versus $500 for toxin, also the nature of the filler business is different than toxin from a patient dynamic and treatment dynamic and that there are more -- there's a longer interval between treatments for fillers versus toxin, which is sort of like a more regular treatment paradigm a few times a year. also, the patient bases are different.
when you think about the toxin patient base and botox cosmetic, the majority of the patient base is continuing patients versus more of a reliance on new patient acquisition. and so, those are some of the factors we're thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in q2, we do continue to expect a positive second-half growth for u.s. juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we're going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter. and those two new fillers will get us into incremental categories for ha fillers, including jawline and skin quality, which will help to drive some incremental demand at the end of the year.
and in terms of your question around economic impact outside of the u.s., we are watching that very closely, and we really have not seen that yet outside of the u.s.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
in terms of your second question, again, it's jeff. thanks for that. we're -- we don't see some significant pressures on skyrizi and rinvoq. now, we always have discussions with the payers, we look at our contracting strategy.
but i think we fall back on our clinical evidence that we have on these two major assets. i mean, we have four head-to-head trials against other major competitors with skyrizi, where we have just really growth superiority versus whether it's an il-17, whether it's humira, which one day will be biosimilar, stelara, etc. so just the pure performance there and the momentum, it's clearly a distinguished asset. we're going to be first in terms of crohn's to start to establish that new area and build the market there.
and i think on rinvoq to some degree, there's only one other jak inhibitor that is not going to have the scope of indications and it's xeljanz. and xeljanz has been significantly wounded based on the oral surveillance data. so, in terms of our ability to build and protect and grow skyrizi and rinvoq into the next stage of development, we're quite confident that we have the assets to be able to do that.
operator
our next question is from steve scala, cowen.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
two questions. first, rick, in the past, you have laid out four factors that will dictate humira's trajectory in 2023. the first two were humira access and biosimilar price, and it's clear it's too early for any news on either of those points. but the second two were competitiveness of biosimilars, which you said in part was interchangeability and also the biosimilar ability to supply the market.
so, those two factors, three and four are things that won't fluctuate and presumably, you have some visibility on that now. so, i'm just wondering if there's anything unusual occurring there. and in discussions, how important is interchangeability with payers. the second question is, and i apologize if i missed it, but are there any updates on the tnf steroid conjugate and is phase 2 ra data still expected this year? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, steve. this is rick. i'll cover the first one.
and roopal can cover the second one. so, you are correct. that is what i described a meeting or two ago as the four variables. i would say, when you think about interchangeability, i think you have to think about it in the backdrop of not just interchangeability, but also what is the profile that is the closest to humira today? and we can look at all the biosimilars and have -- we have pretty good visibility as to what that profile looks like.
and what i would say is, to get a profile that is interchangeable and is consistent with the current humira that's predominantly in the marketplace today, that's probably going to occur in the summer of 2023. there should be one or two biosimilars that have a profile that looks like that. and that would make it somewhat easier for an organization to make a switch. so, i think that will play an important variable.
nothing has changed in the last few months in what that profile looks like. and then obviously, supply is an important aspect that certainly anyone that we're looking at making a significant change in their position with humira is going to want to make sure that they're going with a company that has the ability to be able to produce at volume, at significant volumes, humira, and they can do it sustainably. so, there are certain players that i would say clearly have that ability to be able to do it, similar to us. certainly, no one does it at the scale of us or anywhere close to the scale of us.
but there are also a lot of small players that i think supply is going to be an important aspect and going to somewhat limit the ability to be able to have broad market impact. and so, those are going to be important dynamics as we negotiate with the various managed care organizations. i can tell you that we're talking through those kinds of things with them. roopal?
roopal thakkar -- vice president, regulatory affairs
yes. thanks. yes. so, 154 is our anti-tnf conjugated steroid, as you mentioned, and it's enabled to target delivery of steroid directly to inflammatory cells.
so, we do have that phase 2 running several hundred patients, and we still anticipate getting read later this year and then further data to follow next year.
operator
our next question is chris raymond, piper sadler.
chris raymond -- piper sandler -- analyst
two questions. maybe one that's more broad policy and then another one that's maybe a little bit more detailed. so, maybe first for rick. i know you guys keep pretty close tabs on healthcare policy.
just on the most recent senate democrat drug pricing language in the reconciliation bill. the provisions on the face of it seemed pretty manageable in terms of direct impact from pricing controls, but there's been some concern around this being just the start of something larger in terms of price controls. any thoughts from you guys on this would be appreciated. and then, maybe a more detailed question on abbv-951.
i know you guys haven't provided specific guidance on this or on duodopa, but there seems to be a lot of recognition of 951 among movement disorder kols as a real improvement in terms of overcoming reticence around duodopa. just how should we be thinking about 951 vis-à-vis duodopa, if approved? thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
ok. so, i'll take the first question. i mean, i think if you look at the drug pricing proposal that's out there, it's certainly an important issue for us, and i think it's an important issue for patients. i think if i look at that bill, and i'm assuming that if there were something that were to pass, it would be somewhat consistent with what was in the build back better for the senate finance text.
and so far, it looks like that, but obviously evolving a bit here as we go along. and if i look at it in total, what i'd say is there's a couple of positive things in there. certainly, most notably, the $2,000 cap out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability to be able to smooth, i think that's an important step in increasing affordability, especially for patients in medicare part d. and so, that's something we've been supportive of.
we've been vocal that we think that's an important step forward. what i'd say on balance, this is a bill that has far more negatives than it has positives in it. and i think although it may not be short term that challenging from a financial standpoint, i think the long-term implications of this bill are pretty significant. and they really hinge around this so-called negotiation clause that's in there and how that's being implemented, particularly for small molecules.
and if you're familiar with it, essentially what it says is that cms or we're assuming it will be cms, has the ability at a certain point in time to be able to negotiate a price on a set of drugs. and by the time you get there, it will be a big set of drugs that they'll have the ability to be able to negotiate on. and the key issue is this. essentially, they have full latitude to basically decide whatever price they want the drug to be.
and i wouldn't necessarily call it a negotiation because the only alternative that the manufacturer has is to accept a 95% penalty on their revenues or, in essence, take a 95% discount. so, it's not a negotiation. we should just call it what it is. it's price controls is what they're basically putting in place if the language stays the same.
and ultimately, i think the real challenge is how we invest in this as an industry in innovation. if you take small molecules as an example, i'll walk you through an example that illustrates the point that i'm going to raise here. if you take a small molecule, it says at year nine after the first approval, cms has the right to be able to negotiate the price on that drug. so, if you take an oncology drug as an example, how do we develop oncology drugs in this industry? and what do the regulatory authorities typically require us to do, to be able to develop an oncology drug.
well, they typically require you to do and what we typically do is we go to patients who have failed on all the existing therapies, fourth-line patients, fifth-line patients. and we take whatever drug we have and we determine, do we have a positive benefit risk in that patient population. if we find that we do, then we seek approval for that drug in that patient population, so that those patients will get the benefit of that drug. and then, we start to work our way up toward front line.
those who refractory patients are typically very small populations of patients, right? and you can never get a return on a drug just on that patient population. and then, you work your way up to front line, or second line, or wherever you end up. that process typically takes seven to nine years because of the length of the trials. so essentially, with this, by the time you got to the larger populations, you'd be within a year or two of when cms could change the price.
but one, it's impossible to figure out what the return is going to be, so how do you invest? two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications. but the most detrimental part of it is to patients who need these drugs or small indications or in later stage. because you're faced with the dilemma -- and this is a horrible dilemma, right, as a company and for patients. you're faced with a dilemma of do i choose not to seek approval in those late-stage patients, so i don't start the clock and wait until i'm closer to frontline before i start the clock.
that is not the right policy. and i would say, on balance, this bill will have a couple of things that are good for patients that i'm fully supportive of. but unless congress wants to harm patients and harm innovation in this industry, they need to change that part of it. it doesn't make sense.
it's shortsighted. now, they can change it in a couple of different ways. they can determine, ok, what is a floor price or a maximum discount by year and then you can calculate the return on investment that you're going to have on the drug or they can at least make it consistent with biologics that are out 13 years. otherwise, the investment in small molecule oncology drugs or neuroscience drugs, which medicare patient populations are highly dependent on new innovative drugs in those areas because they're elderly patients, are going to suffer.
and the cbo report that was published back in april of last year clearly pointed that out. so, this isn't something i'm just saying or industry is just saying. and in fact, if anything, i'd say, they probably under call the magnitude of the impact. so, this is an important issue.
we all know the affordability and access for medicare patients is important. but you don't need to destroy the innovation model in the process in order to provide that. and so, i'm hopeful that we'll see some movement here and some rationality will play out.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
ok. and to address your 951 -- hi, it's jeff. thanks for the question. so, i think some perspective is globally, duopa is about $0.5 billion brand.
and certainly, we've said that we believe that 951 could certainly double that up or more. i'll give you the perspective of why we think that way. so, if you look at the advanced parkinson's patients, about 85% sort of cycle when they stay on these generic orals that become less and less and less effective. and the only thing they can really do, and that's about 15% of the market, the advanced parkinson market, is they can move to either deep brain stimulation or duopa.
but you got to go through a surgical barrier. so, the families and the patients are forced to think if i need to get improvement in my symptoms and my quality of life, i'm forced to basically think about do i get a hole in my head or a hole in my stomach with a gastric surgery. this is going to be a subcu. and so, we see in our market research that at least 40% to 60% of people never want to move toward dbs or duopa.
so, we think this is a way where we can start to expand and create a new market segment, in essence, a subcutaneous segment where you don't have to take that risk on the surgery. and like you mentioned in the movement disorder centers, there's a significant amount of experts that are excited about this new option, and we believe that it's going to be a real innovation for patients without having the surgery.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and chris, this is rob. as jeff said, i mean, we expect this to be market expanding. at the jpmorgan conference earlier this year, we did give peak revenue guidance for 951 greater than $1 billion. obviously, duopa is $0.5 billion now.
if you're modeling it, obviously, there'll be some level of cannibalization, i'd say, minor level of cannibalization on duodopa. but when you think about the combination between 951 and duodopa, obviously, it's going to grow the revenue for the company and expand the market.

hi. if i could just go back to the whole '23 versus '24 thing, am i -- i thought that in the past, you guys have said earnings would trough in 2023 and then return to growth in 2024. is that still the case, or is that off the table? and then, second question goes back to the 154 compound, your antibody drug conjugate. we understand that the timing is still on track, but i just -- it feels like to me there's a distinct lack of enthusiasm toward this program, you don't seem to mention that much or at all really, despite its novelty and despite it being in your most critical franchise of immunology.
so, has the enthusiasm waned over, let's say, the last couple of years?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so tim, this is rob. on your first question, what we've said -- we've talked about this 45% with a range around that plus or minus 10% and using, obviously, the europe analog as an example. and in that case, with the steep erosion year one and '23, you would expect then the trough to be in '23 and return to growth in '24. as this plays out, we'll see how that shakes out.
ultimately, if more of it happens in '24, you obviously have another year of growth for all your growth brands. and so, you have a different floor in that scenario. but most importantly, it's what happens in '25 and beyond. when you look at this company with the growth drivers we have, we'll be delivering high-single-digit growth in '25 and beyond, which is industry-leading.
we'll have the lowest loe exposure in the industry in the second half of this decade. and so, we're focused on the long term, we feel very good about the prospects of this business. but as it stands now, the most recent direction we've given is expect that first year erosion, so that 45% plus or minus 10%, which then play out to a return to growth in '24. we'll obviously update the market as we see it play out next year.
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
maybe i'll take this one. this is tom hudson. i'm a clinical immunologist, and i know how we've been using steroids, they can give very profound and deep immunosuppression, decrease inflammation, and that's often used in severe cases when patient shows up. so, we know that the response is very strong, but there are a lot of side effects.
and, when our problem is always weaning, the steroid's out in the clinic. so here, again, the combination of immunomodulator like tnf and steroid have that potential of giving us that deep, deep response very quickly to remove the immunosuppression. and based on the data we've seen preclinically in our phase 1 studies, we're not seeing those biomarkers or side effects in the bone or brain, a cortisol, or others. so we've already demonstrated that, and we have nice data.
the other -- so that's my enthusiasm. we expect to see deep responses, durable responses with much well better tolerated than steroids. our program -- and we've shown this also is that we've actually believed in the platform and we're developing steroid adcs for other targets to target other immune systems -- other immune cells, more specifically around some t cells or some b cells or some fibroblasts. these programs are coming forward.
we think this is a profound platform in immunology to go after different biologies -- in very targeted steroid suppression of different specific immune cell types, and that's going to play out over the next couple of years. so, based on the data we saw, we expanded the platform to other biomarkers getting into other specific immune cell types. of course, we're quiet because we need to see the data, all -- the study has been fully recruited, actually moved faster than we expected. and the day was randomized.
we're just going to see the data in the fall because it's a blinded study. but the enthusiasm is there. and we're also, of course, seeing that data, and then we have pmr because we also started studies there in crohn's disease. we'll see that data later, but the more data we have, the more likely we're going to expand this program to other indications where we believe that deep steroid suppression with tnf might actually bring new solutions for patients.

our next question is geoff meacham, bank of america. your line is open.
geoff meacham -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you so much for the question. not to belabor the point on humira, but i wanted to ask you, is the long-term, meaning the four-year kind of trend that we saw this quarter for humira in europe, is that still a good proxy for how you guys are thinking about the tail for humira, just given we're coming up on four years in europe and we're talking about high single-digit erosion still. so, i wanted to kind of ask you about the tail piece of what you expect in the u.s.
and the second question, just on rinvoq, i wanted to ask you also on the -- since the fda labeling change, you just seen any changes with regard to persistent rates or new starts just on your feedback from the field and how docs view the safety of the jak class. thank you.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
jeff, this is rob. i'll take your first question. so, the way we've talked about humira erosion, it's played out in europe as we saw that steep erosion in year one, more moderate erosion years beyond. in our modeling now, that's probably the best way to think about it is deep erosion year one, more moderate.
you'll have an annualization impact in year two, but more moderate beyond that. and specifically within the wave 1 countries, when we look at europe, and the level of revenue we have this year relative to pre-loe, we still have about 30% of the revenue footprint. so, it gives you a sense of where europe is after four years. obviously, as we model the u.s.
out, and it will be more specific in the future, but right now, we're using europe as an analog.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
and regarding rinvoq in terms of perceptions from the field or what we're seeing. it's largely developing as we predicted. so, we do see segments of physicians that are more wary of the jaks after the label change. however, we anticipated that.
so, we are starting to see a recovery in second line plus in ra as we anticipated. and the new indications because really we'll be the only jak inhibitor with the four big indications of ra, psa, as and then non-radiographic ultimately in the fall. that just builds upon the confidence level of the physician. so, that's what we're feeling from the field.
i'll mention maybe some color on ulcerative colitis. i mentioned that we're encouraged on the ulcerative colitis start. so, we saw in the quarter because we launched in early april. we saw 600 unique gastroenterologists start to write prescriptions, which is quite interesting and good, a positive.
and about half of those customers had never written a jak inhibitor. so, xeljanz was approved. and so, we're seeing, obviously, the ability of these customers to understand the overall risk benefit of rinvoq relative to, let's say, another jak inhibitor. so i feel that our communication is on track, and we're seeing positive feedback as we build the indications that we've highlighted in the call.
operator
our next question is colin bristow with ubs.
colin bristow -- ubs -- analyst
another one on the '23 humira guidance. could you just walk us through -- at the point at the end of 3q, what percentage of contracts or volume will you have confirmed at that point? and then, it sounds like that by the -- by the time you have the full year results, you're still anticipating that there could be a meaningful change. could you just confirm that's a fair characterization? and then just on abbv-154, what are you hoping to see with the phase 2 data that we're going to get at year end? and what's the threshold here that you need to surpass to move forward? thanks.
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
yes. so, if we look at the discussions that we've highlighted and rick highlighted, i think and they're progressing as we would expect. so typically, they start in the late spring. and look, these are complex negotiations.
they go on for many, many months. in many years, we would have completed the -- at least the large pbm negotiations, which is the vast majority of the volume by that october time frame. in some cases, as you probably know, the payers would publish this information. but very often, not always, the immunology an inflammatory segment, those negotiations can go on longer, and they're very often published as a tbd in what used to be called the exclusionary formulary.
so, we would -- as rick mentioned, we would have visibility to sort of the status on the volume in that october time frame. that's a reasonable assumption. again, i don't know for sure, given the complexity of biosimilar negotiation, which has never taken place before. but that's a reasonable way to think about when we'd start to have the visibility to the volume component, as rick highlighted.
roopal thakkar -- vice president, regulatory affairs
yes. and it's roopal on the 154 question. dovetailing on what tom just walked through, things that we want to see are consistent with how we develop in immunology, certainly raising standard of care. so, the way this was designed was to have that anti-tnf and then that direct delivery to avoid systemic side effects of the steroids.
so, you'd see sort of that one-two punch as tom was describing and see that depth of response. so, once we see that type of information along with how it looks from a steroid standpoint, metabolic effects, bone effects taken together will give us a great sense of where it could fit before anti-tnfs, even after we're studying patients that have failed anti-tnfs in this phase 2 study. so, taken together, that will give us a really good sense of where to go. and then remember, we're also going to get data in polymyalgia rheumatic.
it's not an uncommon disease, and these patients are -- many of them are steroid-dependent, 50% or so three years and going and they can't withdraw from steroids and maybe a third can be five plus six years. they're stuck on steroids. so we'll see that data where we're able to prevent them from flaring and to be able to reduce their systemic steroid dose. so, there's multiple facets to this and potentially a number of opportunities and then later on in crohn's disease as well.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, colin.

our next question is from chris shibutani with goldman sachs.
chris shibutani -- goldman sachs -- analyst
two questions, if i could. for skyrizi, if i could just return to this question of how you're thinking about the long-term guidance. i think on skyrizi, recalling that you said $7.5 billion, consisting of about six from the psoriatic complex. and yet you're almost already approaching something close to $5 billion.
so, can you tell us how you're thinking about how that could factor in any long-term thinking? and then, for epcoritamab, positioning of that treatment in the overall treatment paradigm. how are you thinking about that in relation to, for instance, car-t therapy treatment options before, after? thank you.
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
chris, this is rob. i'll take that question. so look, we're very encouraged by skyrizi's continued strong performance. we remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed that 2025 guidance.
now, keep in mind, i mean, the street also reflects that too. street is about $400 million higher than that $7.5 billion. that said, we don't intend on frequently updating that guidance. obviously, we'll provide that guidance update every few years or if there's an event or there's a major disconnect.
so obviously, if the street was way off, we want to point that out. but overall, we're very encouraged about the uptake for skyrizi. it's clearly demonstrating its ability to drive long-term growth for abbvie, and we'll provide an update for long-term guidance at the appropriate time.
neil gallagher -- vice president and chief medical officer
thanks. and on the epcoritamab question. so i'm not going to go through all of the data points again, we've described them several times in the public domain. what i would remind you of is that we've observed extremely robust efficacy in a heavily pretreated population.
now it's true to say that 40% of those patients have sailed car-ts, but 60% of those patients didn't sail car-t. therefore, our expectation, our intention, rather, and as we've mentioned earlier on in tom's prepared remarks, we are anticipating filing for accelerated approval during the second half of this year. and i think that what you can expect is that we believe that the total population, the total relapsed/refractory population, whether or not they sail car-ts should have access to epcoritamab because of the strength of the data overall. in terms of future positioning, we've also discussed in the past our intention of initiating multiple phase -- additional phase 3, the confirmatory study for the dlbcl application what would be the confirmatory study, the phase 3 study is ongoing.
that's in the relapsed/refractory setting. and our anticipation is that we will initiate multiple additional phase 3s, both in dlbcl and other indications over the coming 12 to 18 months.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
maybe i could just build on that. chris, it's jeff. so, we've started to talk to different types of physicians, whether they're in the car-t centers or certainly the community centers. we're increasingly believing that this lymphoma is treated in the community centers.
and so, what we hear, at least at a high level from our research so far is wow, that efficacy is incredibly impressive, even after car-t. but where they go is this simple subcu of epcoritamab may be the fastest way to deliver t cells to my patients i'm dealing with. so to build on neil's point, that data doesn't look like it's niching the drug. in fact, it looks like it's sort of contributing to the idea of like this is a democratized type of medication for the lymphoma.
so, it's very encouraging from our initial work that we're doing with physicians.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, we have time for one final question.
operator
and that question comes from david risinger with svb securities.
david risinger -- svb securities -- analyst
yes. thanks very much, and thanks for all the details on today's call. rick, i was hoping that you could help us to understand the current m&a landscape, how would you characterize it broadly? and then, if you could also comment more specifically on abbvie with respect to the transaction opportunity set for abbvie. thanks very much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
i think, if you look at the m&a environment, i think many players are trying to add to their portfolios. i think there's less of an appetite for larger transactions right now in general across the industry. some of that's probably predicated on the fact that the ftc has been pretty tough in their language around larger kinds of transactions and your ability to be able to get those through. and i think as it relates to us, i mean, we have continued to execute the strategy that we put in place after the allergan transaction.
allergan, obviously brought us a tremendous amount of diversity. that transaction has been highly successful and has really changed the look and the shape of abbvie and it has clearly enhanced our performance, and we've done quite well. our focus is continuing to look for opportunities to be able to fill out our portfolio in areas that we believe there are opportunities to bring in strategic assets. we're probably working more on earlier-stage assets add to our r&d pipeline.
epcoritamab is a good example of the kinds of things that we're out looking for and finding, to supplement the overall pipeline. i think that strategy has worked well, and it's a strategy that we'll continue to do going forward.

operator
good morning and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president, head of investor relations.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; rob michael, vice chairman and president; jeff stewart, executive vice president, chief commercial officer; and tom hudson, senior vice president, r&d, and chief scientific officer. joining us for the q&a portion of the call are laura schumacher, vice chairman, external affairs, chief legal officer, and corporate secretary; carrie strom, senior vice president and president of global allergan aesthetics; scott reents, senior vice president and chief financial officer; neil gallagher, vice president and chief medical officer; and roopal thakkar, vice president, global regulatory affairs. before we get started, i'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman of the board and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone. and thank you for joining us today. i'll briefly comment on our overall performance.
then jeff, tom, and rob will review our second quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. abbvie delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding our expectations. total net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion was up 6.1% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. this performance reflects robust double-digit operational sales growth from immunology, where skyrizi is exceeding our expectations with impressive market share gains in both psoriasis and psa.
skyrizi's recent u.s. approval in crohn's disease will add yet another source of long-term growth. as a result of the strong performance, we've seen in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for skyrizi. rinvoq is also demonstrating strong growth.
ra continues to perform in line with our expectations, following the label update, and we're making very good progress with all of the newly launched indications, including psa, as, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, which collectively represent a significant long-term growth opportunity. neuroscience is another area with outstanding performance vraylar, botox therapeutic and ubrelvy and qulipta each demonstrated double digit sequential sales growth. pending regulatory approvals for vraylar in major depressive disorder, qulipta in chronic migraine and 951 for the treatment of advanced parkinson's disease represent additional near-term growth opportunities for our neuroscience portfolio. turning now to aesthetics, botox cosmetics once again performed very well with sales up more than 20% on an operational basis.
demand for toxins remains strong with high teens growth in the u.s., despite inflation dynamics. as expected, juvederm performance was negatively impacted by covid-related lockdowns in china, as well as the suspension of our operations in russia. additionally, in the u.s., we had a difficult prior-year comparison with a promotional event that we ran last year. we also saw a modest impact in the quarter due to economic pressures.
we continue to expect positive full year growth for juvederm driven by the lessening covid impact in china, and two new filler launches in the u.s. which will benefit growth in the second half of the year. in hematological oncology, imbruvica continues to be unfavorably impacted by a delayed market recovery for new patients starting therapy in cll and increasing competition. these ongoing dynamics will have an impact on imbruvica's projected 2022 revenues.
as a result, we will be adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect these impacts. venclexta to continues to demonstrate robust share performance in both, cll and aml with sales up double digits on an operational basis. venclexta also has registrational studies ongoing in additional attractive indication, such as multiple myeloma in the t(11;14) patient population with phase 3 data forthcoming, as well as high risk mds. additionally, we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both, blood cancers and solid tumors, which are expected to support the next wave of abbvie's growth in oncology.
in summary, the diversity of our portfolio, once again allowed us to deliver another strong performance, despite the challenges we see in the cll market, and increasing imbruvica competition. skyrizi and rinvoq are performing exceptionally well and are on pace to deliver approximately $7.5 billion in combined sales this year. neuroscience demonstrated balanced double digit growth driven by migraine and vraylar baylor, and continued robust botox cosmetic growth offset some of the u.s. inflationary impact to our filler and body contouring portfolios.
as a result, we are confirming our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $13.78 to $13.98, representing growth of more than 17% at the midpoint. with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, commercial operations
thank you, rick. i'm very pleased with the momentum across our therapeutic portfolio, including the continued progress we're making with new product and recent indication launches. i'll start with our immunology portfolio, which delivered total revenues of $7.2 billion, reflecting growth of 19.2% on an operational basis. global humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the u.s., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. skyrizi is performing extremely well, well ahead of our expectations.
global revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 33% on a sequential basis. we continue to advance our leadership position in psoriasis where skyrizi's total prescription share of the u.s. biological market has increased to approximately 26%, driven by an in-play share of new and switching patients that is now approaching 50%. we have also achieved in-play market share leadership in 23 key international markets, including japan, germany, france, canada, and australia.
psoriatic arthritis is also adding significantly to skyrizi's momentum, where we are now approved in 54 countries. in the u.s. dermatology segment, where approximately 30% of patients exhibit both skin and joint involvement, skyrizi is already achieving an in-play patient share of nearly 20%. we have also launched skyrizi for psa in rheumatology, where we're seeing strong utilization, which is driving accelerated share growth.
our recent launch of skyrizi for crohn's disease in the u.s. represents the first new biologic approval in six years for an area where there continues to be considerable unmet need. we believe skyrizi represents a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for crohn's patients, including the potential to provide meaningful levels of endoscopic improvement with novel and infrequent dosing. managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for this indication in the coming months.
turning now to rinvoq, where we're seeing good momentum across each of the approved indications. global sales of $592 million were up more than 27% on a sequential basis. prescriptions in ra remained strong with a total market share of 5.8% in the u.s. and approximately 6% across key international markets.
rinvoq is now achieving an in-play ra share of approximately 13% in the u.s. in psa, rinvoq continues to see nice uptake, especially in the room segment with commercial access now equal to ra. we also recently received fda approval for ankylosing spondylitis and european approval for non-radiographic axial spa, further expanding rinvoq's potential across rheumatology. in atopic dermatitis, new patient starts are tracking in line with our expectations with rinvoq's in-play patient share in the mid-teens.
strong commercial access in ad, which is also now equal to ra and psa, is expected to considerably increase paid prescription volume in this highly underpenetrated market over the remainder of the year. lastly, our recent launch of rinvoq for ulcerative colitis in the u.s. is progressing well. and we recently just received european approval for the same indication.
commercial access in the u.s. is ramping strongly, and we are seeing encouraging new patient starts. physician feedback regarding rinvoq's approved profile in uc has been favorable, especially given the very high rates of remission and endoscopic improvement demonstrated across our uc development program. the addressable patient population for rinvoq in uc is substantial, with nearly 50% of patients currently on or having used tnf therapy.
turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 7.9% on an operational basis. imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.1% and below our expectations. the clo market continues to remain challenging in the u.s. with new patient starts down double digits relative to pre-pandemic levels.
now, as you may recall, our initial 2022 imbruvica sales guidance contemplated a partial market recovery, which, unfortunately, we have not yet observed. in fact, the latest data reflects new patient starts in the u.s. were actually down high single digits versus last year. so, based on recent trends, we no longer believe it's prudent to anticipate a meaningful market recovery in cll over the second half of this year.
therefore, we will be removing this assumption from our 2022 guidance. in addition, increasing competition from newer therapies, including other btk inhibitors as well as our own venclexta also continue to lower imbruvica's share of new patient starts, especially in frontline cll. despite this increasing competitive pressure, imbruvica continues to be the total market share leader across all lines of therapy in cll. venclexta global sales were $505 million, up 21.2% on an operational basis.
in cll, we continue to see share gains in the u.s. and across all major international markets. we're also seeing continued strong performance in aml. venclexta is now approved in 80 countries and in many markets is already considered the new standard of care for frontline aml patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
as a result, we are seeing ramping market share throughout the countries where we have launched. in neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. vraylar once again delivered strong growth. sales of $492 million were up 13.9% on an operational basis, reflecting continued share gains in the u.s.
atypical antipsychotic market. our launch preparations remain well underway in anticipation of our mdd approval in the fourth quarter. this is a potentially large indication that would represent incremental upside to our current projections for vraylar. within migraine, ubrelvy remains the market-leading oral cgrp treatment for acute migraine with revenue of $185 million, up 34% on a sequential basis.
qulipta continues to increase its leading new-to-brand share in the u.s. preventative cgrp class when we consider both, paid and bridge volume. we continue to make good progress with expanded commercial access, which will support strong qulipta sales growth over the remainder of this year. we are also pursuing the commercial approval for qulipta as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine in the u.s.
as well as a new therapy for europe, potentially further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. botox therapeutic is also performing well in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $678 million, up 14.5% on an operational basis. so overall, i'm pleased with the commercial execution across the therapeutic business. our broad portfolio of differentiated therapies and new launches is demonstrating strong revenue growth.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to tom for additional comments on our r&d programs. tom?
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
thank you, jeff. i'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline updates in our inflammatory bowel disease programs for both, skyrizi and rinvoq. we recently received fda approval for skyrizi in crohn's disease, and we're very pleased with the label which reflects a strong benefit risk profile that skyrizi demonstrated as an induction and maintenance treatment for this condition. based on its profile, we believe skyrizi will be a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for patients with crohn's disease.
our regulatory application for skyrizi in crohn's disease remains under review in europe with an approval decision expected near the end of this year. also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently received european approval for rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. and we're excited to bring this new, highly efficacious oral option to patients suffering from this often debilitating disease. in the quarter, we also completed a registrational program for rinvoq in crohn's disease, reporting positive top-line results from our phase 3 maintenance study we recently submitted our regulatory applications for rinvoq in this indication and expect approval decisions next year.
once approved for crohn's disease, rinvoq will have completed development programs for all the major rheum and gastro indications covered by humira plus atopic dermatitis. the strength of the data generated in our clinical programs should position rinvoq as a highly differentiated treatment across this broad indication set and enable rinvoq to deliver significant value to abbvie over the long term. and just this morning, we announced that we received european approval for rinvoq in non-radiographic axial spa, which rounds out rinvoq's label in rheumatology. moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline.
at the recent eha meeting, we presented results from the large b-cell lymphoma expansion cohort in the phase 2 study evaluating epcoritamab in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. in this study, epcoritamab was well tolerated and drove very deep and durable responses in challenging to treat highly refractory patients with large b-cell lymphoma. we recently discussed these results with regulatory agencies and based on the strength of the data, we intend to submit regulatory applications later this year for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large b-cell lymphoma. we expect approval decisions in 2023.
we continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for venclexta and remain on track to see results from the phase 3 canova trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. as a reminder, we've seen very promising results in this population in prior clinical studies with venclexta showing high overall response rates and meaningful trends toward prolonged progression-free survival. the level of efficacy we've seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to venclexta and this agent has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in the multiple myeloma market. in neuroscience, following successful completion of our phase 3 chronic migraine prevention study, we submitted our regulatory application to the fda for qulipta in chronic migraine.
chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least eight of those days associated with migraines. this is a debilitating disease that affects nearly 10% of people suffering from migraine, significantly impacting their quality of life. if approved, this would be another differentiating feature for qulipta as it would be the only oral cgrp approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. we also submitted data from our phase 3 prevention studies in both, chronic and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the u.s.
we expect approval decisions in the u.s. and in europe in 2023. in the quarter, we submitted our regulatory application in the u.s. for abbv-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced parkinson's disease.
this innovative delivery system has the potential to become a transformative treatment option for patients with advanced parkinson's disease by providing duopa-like efficacy with less invasive nonsurgical administration. we also expect to submit our regulatory application in europe later this year with approval decisions anticipated in both, the u.s. and europe in 2023. now, i'd like to provide a few updates on some earlier-stage programs where we have new data and are advancing programs in development.
in immunology, we recently obtained encouraging data in a phase 2 study evaluating rinvoq in systemic lupus, an autoimmune multisystem disease. in our study, rinvoq demonstrated greater response rates as well as a reduction in flares compared with placebo. we'll see longer-term data in the coming months, which will allow us to make a decision on moving rinvoq into phase 3 for lupus. in oncology, where we have a pipeline of promising early stage programs aimed at solid tumors, we are beginning to see very exciting data from several programs.
our anti-garp antibody, abbv-151 is designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory t cells, which leads to increased t cell effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. this reactivates the immune system against tumors, enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by a pd-1 inhibitor. in our phase 1 program, we're combining 151 with a pd-1 checkpoint inhibitor in cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsed after pd-1 as well as evaluating this combination in pd-1 nonresponsive tumors. based on the preliminary efficacy we've seen in the dose expansion cohorts for multiple solid tumors, including a deepening of responses over time and prolonged durability, we recently declared proof-of-concept for 151.
we plan to advance to phase 2 in several solid tumors, starting with urothelial cancer. we're also expecting additional data readouts later this year in other solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer, which may enable further expansion studies in this hard-to-treat cancer type. we will also begin new studies to explore a broader set of solid tumors where garp is implicated as a critical immunosuppressive pathway, based on tumor tissue analyses. we're also making excellent progress with our next-generation c-met abbv-400, where the emerging clinical data is very promising in several solid tumors.
this asset is similar to teliso-v as c-met adc that uses a microtubulin inhibitor payload. teliso-v received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with a subtype of lung cancer with high levels of c-met overexpression. the toxin warhead for 400 uses a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which is similar to irinotecan, a chemotherapy that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. by targeting c-met positive tumors with adcs bearing different warheads we believe we can broaden the range of solid tumors where c-met therapies can be used.
in our phase 1 program, we are seeing good responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and remain encouraged by these early efficacy signals. so in summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year, and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2022. so, with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, tom. abbvie's second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio. momentum from new products and recently launched indications allows us to maintain our earnings outlook despite market dynamics for imbruvica, higher inflation, and the stronger u.s. dollar.
we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, reflecting growth of 11.2% compared to prior year and $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. these results include a $0.14 unfavorable impact from acquired ipr&d expense. total net revenues were $14.6 billion, up 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 220 basis points versus the prior year.
this includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 11% of sales, acquired ipr&d expense of 1.8% of sales and adjusted sg&a expense of 20.8% of sales. net interest expense was $532 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. turning to our financial outlook. we are confirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance between $13.78 and $13.98.
this earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. we now expect net revenues of approximately $58.9 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.7% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions.
we now expect skyrizi global sales of approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of $400 million due to strong market share performance. for imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, given the lack of recovery in the cll market and increasing competition. moving to the p&l, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales and continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. turning to the third quarter.
we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.8 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.55 and $3.59. this guidance does not include acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred in the quarter.
in closing, we delivered strong performance again this quarter, including meaningful contributions from new products and recently launched indications. given the momentum of our business as well as our pipeline advancements, we are well-positioned for the long term. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, rob. we will now open the call for questions. in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. operator, we'll take the first question.
",2022-Q2,ABBV
,,,,":
operator
thank you. our first question is from chris schott from j.p. morgan.
chris schott -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. thanks so much. just my question is really centered around humira. and i know you -- appreciate some of the access commentary you made at beginning of the call, but are there any surprises so far in these discussions as we think about where either rebates or prices settling out for humira? and i'm really sure i was trying to get my hands around, i think previously, you've commented you expected u.s.
humira erosion to be down roughly 45%, plus or minus 10%. and i just was wondering if that range holds given what you know today about the negotiations? and if i could just do a quick follow -- second question, immunology. there was a european jak update out this morning, and i just was wondering any impact you expect to the rinvoq franchise for that? just maybe some context about how relevant, i guess, europe was as part of the mix? and does that label update kind of impact your outlook at all? thanks so much.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok, chris, this is rick. i'll cover part of that question, and then i'll have jeff fill in on any additional commentary around the contracting. i think first, if we talk about the 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is the range that we gave. we're obviously working on doing the final forecasting for 2023.
as we've said in the past, there are two major components, which will play into that forecast. one is how are the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. we won't know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity. but the other big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for humira and the position that humira has on those formularies.
i would say that negotiating by jeff's team is going very well. as i mentioned in my comments, we're at about 80% of all covered lives now, and i would expect that to rise to a level that's above 90% as we move toward the end of the year. once we have a final number there, it will allow us to do the final modeling for 2023, and that's at the point where we'll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. i'd tell you it's going on track.
i would say there's no surprises, and i'd say i feel good about how the negotiations are going with all the major managed care organizations and pbms. jeff, anything you'd add there?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
no. just to confirm, rick, that no real surprises in terms of where we've been. and as we've communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be the way that the market will play out. and certainly, like we saw in europe that we had the principle of -- for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access.
so chris, no major surprises that we've seen so far.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
and then do you want to talk about prac? maybe you and roopal, can talk about prac.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
maybe, roopal, you could address the procedure and where we are in the procedure, and i'll cover the commercial.
roopal thakkar -- vice president, regulatory affairs
yeah. thanks, jeff. i'll give some context. so the next step here after prac would be moving to the chmp here in november, and then the european commission should finalize this.
we expect december or january. so prac completed their review, and what we see in the labeling is an update in warnings, and this is related to outcomes of the oral surveillance study. and in particular, in section 4.4, which is the warnings, there's a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. for example, patients greater than equal to the age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example.
and in these patients, the use of jak inhibitors would be after a consideration of other therapies, if i'm paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives. so this is consistent with the practice of medicine. it provides specific guidance, and we would say pragmatic at this stage.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. and chris, to that point, i mean, this is largely consistent with what we see from oral surveillance and the xeljanz label, which is widely sort of understood by the european physicians. and so to cut to the quick, we don't anticipate a material impact as this continues through the process.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from tim anderson from wolfe research.
tim anderson -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. i was under the impression that we get more granularity on humira erosion this quarter, and you're saying that's really going to come in q4. so, i'm wondering did i kind of not hear it right before, or has something changed? and then second question is just on contracting in general, my understanding is that payer contracts, really not rock solid. they can be reopened when there's a change in the marketplace on things like pricing, in this case of biosimilars.
so, when we do kind of get whatever next level of guidance we get from you, isn't that going to continue to remain fluid? because market dynamics won't all play out as of january, we'll get to mid next year, you'll get more entrants, you'll know pricing better and that sort of thing? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, tim, this is rick. i'll cover that one. so, i think we've talked a number of times on these calls about what we project in the third quarter call, and i believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on where we were in the process. and so that's what we attempted to do.
i can't give you a number for 2023 until i know what the total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. they're proceeding well, so i feel good about that. but until we actually know that the contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can't give you an accurate projection. and i understand the desire by the investment community.
i understand what that number is, but i think you probably also understand that we want to give you the most accurate number that we can give you, and we don't want to give you a number that's not accurate. and so it is going to require us until we get to the fourth quarter call to provide that for you. you are correct, in a sense, about the way you describe how these contracts work. they can be reopened at some point in time.
i wouldn't say that's all that common usually, and in particular, i'd say around this kind of a situation, you're going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in the second half of the year and try to position the contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. but you are correct to say that they could reopen a contract if they chose to do that. there are various kinds of contracts that we use. in some cases, there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time.
they're not all like that, but many are like that. so it varies. and i'd say generally speaking, your concept is valid. but i would say it's probably a little less fluid than the way you necessarily described it, particularly in this environment where we know there will be a number of biosimilars coming in.
so you anticipate that we've built the contracts around that set of assumptions. jeff, anything you'd add?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
no, i think, tim, rick described it in the right way. while there are typically, there are typically out clauses based on timing or other dynamics. i think one of the considerations is obviously, as we've highlighted before. most of the biosimilars are going to be coming in the second half of the year.
so to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. and they typically are rare where a contract is blown up or renegotiated in the middle of the year. that length of time that's left in 2023 for some of those payers to let's take a negative action puts some natural constraint on them in terms of when they would time that out. but rick highlighted it very nicely in terms of the dynamics.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, tim. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from mohit bansal from wells fargo.
mohit bansal -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my question. and maybe one more question on the contracting side. could you help us understand if the pricing part of the contracts is something that you have a good handle on at this point? and then a follow-up question is that how do you think about the cadence of bd activity once you hit the mark of less than two times leveraged by end of the year? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
jeff, do you want to cover that?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah, so look, in terms of what rick had highlighted in terms of our confidence in projecting the 80%. obviously, there's a couple components to that. so we have -- while all the contracts aren't fully complete with the ones that we've done. we've done some significant modeling work to understand if we're retaining the ability to stay on the formulary.
we would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. that's something that we can understand. and we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. now what's been highlighted in the last couple of questions is there's still uncertainty on the rest of the contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic.
so those are the elements that are going to give us more confidence as we go to the fourth quarter call to give everyone a secure number for next year.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
this is rick. i'll cover your business development question. i think if i step back and i look at where are we today. we have been for the last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to the business.
we've effectively used that over the last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, i'd say early stage pipeline assets to the company. we're continuing on that same approach right now. now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. we will be in a position where if we chose to do something, we could do something.
i'd say if i look at the business today and i look at how it's performing around the expectations that we had for the business going forward, i would say there's no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. and i'd go back to the original premise of what we described to the investment community of what we believed would happen when biosimilars entered the u.s. market for humira. what we said was that we believe the bulk of the erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond.
we would return to significant growth. we'd be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through the end of the decade. that's what we said. everything i know about the business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that.
and we're confident that we're able to do that with the portfolio we have and the late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. having said that, i can also tell you that, over the last 10 years, we've demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. and so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to the business, we certainly have the financial wherewithal and this business has tremendous cash flow. we could do that.
i can tell you we don't see that right now. so i wouldn't assume that. and the other thing i'd point out is, as an example, the most important thing, and i know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but -- and i know why. but probably the single most important thing for us going forward to hit what i described to you a moment ago is that underlying non humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations.
and that's key and i'd say there's two factors that are most important around that. the first is that skyrizi and rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. and i feel highly confident in that. i mean, when you can look at the trajectories of those assets now in the early phase we're in right now in ibd and psa.
i would say, i have a very high level of confidence that they will perform at that level or well above that level. then the second thing is all the other growth assets they have to be growing fast enough that they can get us to be able to grow at that rate that i described. and if you take this quarter as an example, and you look at the business without humira, the underlying growth is about 6.5%. and remember that 6.5% is absorbing the economic impact we see in the aesthetics business and the market and competitive dynamics that we see in imbruvica.
so that's -- that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. and so i think those are the important things that investors have to focus on. and the erosion curve is certainly one of those. and i'm sensitive to the fact that you want to know when you're going to hit trough earnings, and i recognize that.
and that's why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, mohit. operator, next question, please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from terence flynn from morgan stanley.
terence flynn -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions. maybe two for me. rick, i appreciate your comments on 2023 and the aesthetics business. no, you don't want to give guidance.
but i guess at a high level, do you think you can grow that franchise next year versus this year? and then on epcoritamab, congratulations on the filing there. just wondering what you're expecting regarding the requirement for inpatient administration. j&j recently got approval of their bispecific and myeloma and looks like there's a requirement there for inpatient administration of the drug during the step up period. so just wondering how we should think about inpatient versus outpatient dosing of epco? thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok, excellent. thanks, terence. i'll cover the first one. so if i look at the aesthetics business, we're clearly seeing this economic pressure in the u.s.
and i would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. certainly, it's difficult to predict what will happen in the u.s., will it get worse? will we go into a recession? will it stay about the same? i'd say, we're looking at this extremely carefully. but good news right now i would say is that the factors that we're looking at that seem to be driving this consumer confidence and behavior the most in the u.s., appeared to have stabilized at the levels that they're at. and so i would say that's a positive thing.
now it's fluid because obviously if the economic situation got worse in the u.s., my guess is they would trend down again. and so -- but at least it appears right now that they've stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. i think it's very difficult to predict. here's what i would assume.
i would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. now also recognize that we saw this phenomena as we said in the last call start in may. we weren't sure at the time whether it was the summer season starting a month early or it was the economic impact, because we had been watching the indicators and they trend down several months ahead of that. but we didn't see an impact until the month of may.
so the point is, when we hit may and beyond, we're going to be lapping the impact. so the negative impact will be softened on the business. so we'll return to better growth rates no matter what just mathematically, right. so -- but i think the best prediction we can have is it's going to have an impact in a good part of 2023.
i think it's the best way for us to think about it. now again, the rest of the business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in this quarter.
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
and this is rob. i would just add that if you think about more long term. if you think about what happened in '08 and '09, the business declined high single digits and then we saw, after that very robust growth in the mid-teen to the next decade. so given that penetration rates are still very low today.
there's clearly ample opportunity to grow this market. i think once you get on the other side of the economic impact which we expect to be transient. we still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as rick highlighted earlier, we're still on track for that. long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029.
so we'll have to navigate, obviously, the short-term economic impact. but we still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for aesthetics.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
epco?
neil gallagher -- vice president, development and chief medical officer
hey, this is neil gallagher. i will take the epco question. so the first thing i just want to caution, put a word of caution before i answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that the patient population that our competitors studied with the bcma, cd3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. so the indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very heavily pretreated and frail population.
so to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into the relapsed/refractory dlbcl population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution there. that said, the study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight -- one overnight stay. however, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require -- be required to remain overnight. and we do believe because of the emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has the potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue.
hope that answered your question.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks terence. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from andrew baum from citigroup global.
andrew baum -- citi -- analyst
thank you. a couple of questions please. first on in imbruvica, i'm assuming that imbruvica is going to be included in the top 10 cms lists for price negotiation under medicare next year. assuming that's correct what do you think about the impact on net pricing from imbruvica.
do you anticipate pricing -- net pricing coming under pressure prior to 2026, given the contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure favorable positions given their catastrophic coverage burden on pbms post the ira implementation? so is the impact going to get brought forward for the class including for imbruvica before you actually get the price cut coming? and then then seconds with epcoritamab, there's been some interesting data on the importance of profound b-cell depletion in lupus using car t assets, as cd20 bispecific could get to a similar level. i'm wondering whether you have interest in pivoting epcoritamab and exploring it in refractory lupus as one of your competitors already is particularly given you have a subcu administration, which obviously has some advantages? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. hi andrew, it's jeff. i'll take your first question. so when we -- obviously we're still studying very carefully the ira and we're also discussing directly with cms not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how they're going to basically select the different drugs that will be negotiated.
that's a little bit unclear at this point. it's not unreasonable based on the size of imbruvica to suspect it will be one of the earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. in terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, i would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. we see very small levels at this point now but we do have a third competitor coming.
so that would be something that we would continue to plan for as we move into that potential event.
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
yeah. this is tom. maybe i'll answer the lupus question. first, i'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that b-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission.
it's a very small study. some five patients, but everyone's looking at this as a -- even with a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms themselves in lupus. so that was one of the reasons it's so difficult. i used to be part of a lupus clinic in montreal, so i know the challenges with patients.
so what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, the answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do b-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? the answer is yes. and the type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in heme malignancies? nobody knows the answer. that might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of the severe patients and again that would be an advantage. but if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all the time.
the majority have a normal life. go to the clinic once a year and just see their physicians when they have flares. so going to a very deep regimen for b-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. so the questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's the right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks andrew. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steve scala from cowen.
steve scala -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you. what is your level of confidence in a positive outcome for vraylar in mdd at the end of the year? i imagine the review is well along, so you probably have good visibility. so for instance our labeling discussions underway, is the sales force being trained, etc. this is a very large opportunity that does not seem to be a point of external focus as far as i could tell.
so i'm wondering what you could tell us about how things are going. thank you.
roopal thakkar -- vice president, regulatory affairs
hi, it's roopal. thanks for the question. maybe i'll go and then jeff can talk about the opportunity. you're correct, the review is proceeding per our expectations.
we have two positive studies in the space. i mean, recall, we also have the same endpoint -- the depression endpoint that's read out in three other bipolar depression studies that are already within label. so there's quite a bit of evidence that's already been generated, that's in front of the agency now. so i would say it's proceeding well and we still anticipate a decision by year end.
and i'll pass it to jeff.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, i mean, we are very encouraged and excited about this potential approval. i mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication -- the bipolar indications. and we know that based on the profile that we have with vraylar.
so very, very strong efficacy -- proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and i think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's -- there's no titration. you have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. so as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as this potential add-on therapy and depression. in the last decade there's been only one drug that's been approved for this indication and that's rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well.
so we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. we are gearing up in terms of training. we have the established relationships across the big primary care doctors, as well as the psychiatrist. so we are -- we agree with your approach.
that's a meaningful commercial opportunity that could evolve very quickly here once we get the approval.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, steve. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from gary nachman from bmo capital markets.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. first could you just provide some more color on how much of a benefit you're seeing for skyrizi and rinvoq and ibd? as you've been spending more time with the gis, and have your outlooks changed on a potential there as major contributors to the long-term growth for those franchises? so where are both of those being used in the treatment paradigms for the respective indications in crohn's and ulcerative colitis? so that's one. and then secondly, just opex came in much lower than we expected, so you seem to be getting better operating leverage than what you originally guided.
are there areas where you've scaled back in spending, whether in aesthetics or heme/onc if there's pressures there? and how will you be thinking about that into the humira loe next year? so how much additional flexibility might you have on the spending side? thanks.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. i'll take the ibd question. i think we've mentioned before that the ibd has been a very important part of our long range plan and when we gave the 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because they're just ramping now. i would say that as abbvie we are very, very encouraged.
as i mentioned in my prepared remarks on the launch, and maybe i'll start with what we're hearing from the gastroenterologists. i think first is they, they look at both assets and the global guidelines, the impressions and the clinical approach that we hear from the top leaders and also the community gastros is this idea over, i have to start to think about endoscopic healing, higher basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in the bowel versus just symptoms. and that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the rinvoq side in second line in the u.s. second line for patients that aren't doing well in uc.
so we see rapid adoption already as i mentioned, that in the rinvoq in the united states will be a second line plus based on the label. and we see very, very fast adoption. i'll give you some color on it. xeljanz had been approved and is approved in uc in the united states, but basically it had very low adoption.
we're seeing now in the community that 70% of the prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a jak before. so it shows you that the clinical profile of rinvoq in terms of its speed and the depth of the response is being viewed very, very well. so not only is that encouraging for rinvoq, you see as i mentioned we're going to have the approval for crohn's for rinvoq in later lines next year as well. skyrizi continues to surprise us to the upside, as you've heard from the call today.
this is viewed increasingly as the preferred frontline drug coming straight out of the gate for crohn's in the u.s. and the qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that this is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for crohn's, which is a very, very substantial market. so we are very encouraged. we continue to say that the ibd is probably underappreciated, and we'll continue to give updates as these launches progress.
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so gary, this is rob. i'll take your question on opex. if you look at the benefit we're seeing, about half of it is actually coming from the stronger u.s. dollar, so it's more of an fx impact.
the other half is spend productivity. we always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. it's not so much about scaling back in parts of the business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. and ultimately, that helps us.
in many cases also, over the long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. if you think about '23, i've said, given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. i've also said we're not going to cut back investment. we'll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we're not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly.
so you'll see us not necessarily cut back, but certainly put more behind this business to drive that long-term growth that we expect to be industry-leading over the long term.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, gary. operator, next question please.
operator
and our next question comes from colin bristow from ubs.
colin bristow -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. so first on cf, you recently posted an updated clinical trials for your new c2 corrector-based regimen. i just wondered if you could walk us through what gives you confidence that this has a higher probability of success versus your last deterioration? and then second one for rick, i just wanted to touch base on your succession plan.
it's been an increasingly sort of important or a frequent topic with investors. you've been the architect of abbvie's success inception, and so just wanted to confirm specifically how long you expect to stay in the seat? and then how should we think about the time lines around the process of identifying your successor? thank you.
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
well, this is tom, i'll answer the cf question. again, this is very challenging to actually make that abnormal cf protein get to the membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to the cell membrane and open up in the right way. and so we all felt that we had intakes, we call them corrector 1, corrector 2 and potentiator, these three different compounds. we always see good results with double our c1 corrector.
we think it's best-in-class. our potentiator is very good. what we had difficulty is to get a good c2 corrector, and what i presented earlier this year was that it wasn't good enough. but what we've done since then, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576, which is structurally different and the data supports higher safety margin, higher exposures, good pk.
hopefully, a single pill. and then we'd be able to get to this -- to be able to have this triplet which is really important to be competitive. so again, our doublet, the data we had was very strong. but we need that third piece, and that third piece seems to be coming along really well.
that's what you really saw on the website at ct.gov is moving to evaluate this triple combo with our new c2 corrector.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
and this is rick on the succession question. i'd say that, we obviously have a very experienced board, and we've had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. and that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume the role when i do retire. i can tell you that there are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023.
the most important thing to me and to the board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we're not going to make any transition until we've gone through the biosimilar event, and we're confident in the performance of the overall business. that would be the appropriate time once we're confident to make a transition at that point. we've also had discussions with the board of what that transition would look like. and assuming it's an internal candidate, the transition will essentially work where we will name a new ceo.
and at that point, i will assume the role of executive chair for a period of time thereafter. so i think we have a well-thought-out succession approach. i feel very comfortable with the approach, i feel comfortable with the work we're doing to develop the internal candidates. and i think the transition when it occurs, i think, will go smoothly and be successful.
so hopefully, that answers your question.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, colin. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chris shibutani from goldman sachs.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
chris, are you there? we can't hear you.
operator
please check your mute feature, chris?
chris shibutani -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, apologies. two questions, if i may. on rinvoq, you had previously commented that you were seeing some use in the first-line setting. can you update us at all with any color there? secondly, for skyrizi, obviously, a very attractive market and an opportunity in crohn's disease.
can you show us how you're thinking about the potential impact given the loe in 2023 of a major branded players, stelara? thank you.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
chris, it's jeff. just to clarify in terms of your rinvoq question, was there a specific question related to a certain indication on the front line? or i'm not sure i fully appreciate that one.
chris shibutani -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, no. in ad.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
in ad, ok, right. so yes, we do see frontline use across the globe and even in the u.s. and what we're seeing is now, as i mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing in-line in-play share, which is in the high mid-teens right now in the u.s., and it's higher in the international markets. so there seems to be, as we look to the research and we look to our market -- end market performance, there's really two segments of dermatologists.
there's very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt jaks, and typically, they'll start in the later line, a second line plus. there is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at the underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like the ez90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for the product. they typically are starting to use more and more in the frontline. so the overall balance is leaning toward the second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on the profile of the drug in atopic dermatitis.
in terms of the skyrizi for crohn's, we think we're very, very well-positioned for a couple of reasons. one is the overall profile of the medicine is really exceptional, as i've highlighted, and we're going to see very, very rapid adoption both in the u.s. and the external market. in addition, we have anticipated the stelara loe.
we see that we have an ongoing head-to-head trial versus stelara to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over the next year or so, so we're anticipating that. and we think we're going to have a good setup to maintain the early momentum that we're seeing with skyrizi.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, chris. operator, next question please.
operator
thank you. our next question is from geoff meacham from bank of america.
geoff meacham -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys. thanks so much for taking the question. i just have one quick one. rick, lots of questions on humira for next year, but i wanted to ask at a high level environment beyond that.
i know there are formal treatment guidelines in i&i, but what's the risk that payers mandate cycling through one or more biosimilars? and what's the risk of the pricing environment doesn't really recover in '24 and beyond? just obviously thinking about the skyrizi and rinvoq franchises over the long term. thank you.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'm actually going to have jeff walk you through that. he's probably the closest to that environment.
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah, so thank you for the question. i mean, one of the things that we see certainly in the near term is that the formularies in i&i are actually expanding. so many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. the payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you're seeing an expansive nature in the short term.
now as you go forward, maybe middle of the decade or later where you have more and more biosimilars, could the u.s. environment move toward sort of a step through? i mean, it's possible. but we have, again, as i mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with the right types of data, the trials. we have five head-to-head studies in skyrizi in psoriasis, we have more coming in crohn's.
and so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that's going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. the other dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about this during the immunology investor day, is the lines of therapy as there's more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand. so in the middle of the decade or longer, the second plus and the third line markets are going to be very, very significant at that point. so when we put all of that into the calculus we feel again, we have a pretty set up for the middle of the decade and longer.
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
and this is rick. i agree with everything jeff said. the one thing i would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time. so even if you had to rotate through you're going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through another tnf typically doesn't work very well for those patients.
and i'd say the domain now with the kind of agents that we have in the market now and the level of remission that they can create, the demand among physicians is much higher to get patients into remission as rapidly as they possibly can. and so i think all those dynamics tell us that this model should continue to work over the long-haul.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, geoff. i believe we have taken all the questions in the queue, so that concludes today's conference call. if you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. thanks again for joining us.

operator
good morning, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the abbvie's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to introduce ms. liz shea, vice president, head of investor relations.
liz shea -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and thanks for joining us. also on the call with me today are rick gonzalez, chairman of the board and chief executive officer; rob michael, vice chairman and president; jeff stewart, executive vice president, chief commercial officer; and tom hudson, senior vice president, r&d and chief scientific officer. joining us for the q&a portion of the call are carrie strom, senior vice president and president, global allergan aesthetics; scott reents, senior vice president and chief financial officer; neil gallagher, vice president, development and chief medical officer; and roopal thakkar, vice president, global regulatory affairs. before we get started, i will note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
abbvie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our sec filings. abbvie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. on today's conference call, non-gaap financial measures will be used to help investors understand abbvie's business performance.
these non-gaap financial measures are reconciled with comparable gaap financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. so with that, i'll now turn the call over to rick. 
rick gonzalez -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, liz. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll briefly comment on our overall performance then jeff, tom and rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. abbvie continues to perform very well, a testament to the strength of our broad, diversified portfolio.
i'm especially pleased with the performance of our immunology assets, skyrizi and rinvoq. we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with skyrizi and rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales this year, well ahead of our initial expectations.
this performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in the early launch phase for both assets in ibd and psa, as well as rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. skyrizi and rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in the collective potential of these two assets to ultimately exceed the peak revenues achieved by humira, achieving the strategic objective we had for replacing humira. we also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including botox cosmetic, vraylar, venclexta and botox therapeutic. this strong momentum is helping us offset some of the interim economic pressure we now see in our aesthetics portfolio.
based on these results, we remain confident in the outlook of our business and are reaffirming the midpoint of our full year 2022 eps guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. as many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesthetics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. we have been monitoring the global economic situation. based on all the data we have been observing, especially in the u.s.
with both the consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, these factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. this metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across the aesthetics markets, impacting the growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. while our u.s. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact juvederm, as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers.
while it's difficult to predict the duration of these economic dynamics, we expect these conditions to persist into 2023. as consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect the market growth to accelerate. our aesthetics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following the 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. over the long-term, the aesthetics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.
the current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesthetics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. i also want to provide a brief update on the outlook for 2023. with regards to the status of contracting for humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. we are making very good progress consistent with this objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all u.s.
covered lives. we expect this percentage to increase further as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and the end of the year. as a result, we anticipate strong access for u.s. humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as they become available.
we will provide sales guidance for humira on our fourth quarter call. while we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that when we issue our eps outlook, we expect the lower end of the range to represent for earnings. so while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of the shape of the erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than the initial 2023 eps guidance given the momentum and growth from another year of our ex-humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental humira erosion in 2024. we know that many investors have an interest in the timing of abbvie's trough earnings, whether that would be 2023 or 2024.
the guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for the company's core eps. in summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. to that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in february 2023. since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. jeff?
jeff stewart -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
thank you, rick. we once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. i'll start with immunology, where we are well-positioned for sustained leadership in this extremely attractive market. total immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis.
we remain very excited about the long-term potential for skyrizi and rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on abbvie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. in psoriasis, skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in the u.s.
biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. we have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including japan, canada and france. psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just this year. our psa performance is especially strong in the u.s.
dermatology segment, where we have already achieved 10% total market share. lastly, our launch of skyrizi for crohn's disease in the u.s. is progressing very well. early prescription trends, as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwhelmingly positive, especially given skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile.
importantly, commercial access for skyrizi crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and psa with sales in this indication expected to ramp significantly over the next several quarters. given the momentum we are seeing across the indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for skyrizi. turning now to rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in ra, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the u.s. and across key international geographies.
global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in psa ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spa, a testament to the strong clinical profile rinvoq has demonstrated across the broader rheumatology segment. rinvoq is now the only jak inhibitor with global approval for all four major room indications. in atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for rinvoq, particularly in the second-line setting. u.s.
in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. ad remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for rinvoq. lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by the early prescription trends in the u.s. in the second line plus setting, rinvoq is already achieving the second highest in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months' post launch.
physicians have been pleased with rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic healing, as well as the speed of onset. with over 70% of bioexperience uc patients currently on or having used tnf therapy, the second line plus opportunity for rinvoq in uc is substantial. this strong adoption in uc among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for rinvoq's potential in crohn's disease as well. we are on track for u.s.
and ema regulatory decisions in the first half of 2023. global humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the u.s., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%.
the u.s. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging cll market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-covid levels. given the u.s. cll market has been consistently lower than our expectation in the past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of the total size of the addressable patient population for this indication going forward.
we also anticipate further share erosion following the recent unfavorable change to the nccn guideline preference for imbruvica in cll, as well as increasing existing and new competition. these market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on imbruvica's 2023 performance. venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer cll market in the u.s.
and a higher foreign exchange impact on international revenues. as a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for venclexta. longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for dlbcl, and follicular lymphoma, venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk mds; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and teliso-v for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. we are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of these important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients.
in neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. vraylar once again delivered strong growth. sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. we continue to anticipate the regulatory approval and the commercial launch of vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder this quarter, which would make vraylar the only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat the most common forms of depression, both bipolar i, and adjunctive, and dd.
within migraine, our market leading oral cgrp portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales this quarter. ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. excluding this one-time adjustment, ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus the prior year. qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access.
potential label expansion in the u.s. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new therapy approvals in europe represent additional opportunities to support qulipta's strong momentum. botox therapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. in chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our therapeutic sales, botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and the clear branded leader for existing, as well as new patient starts.
lastly, our launch preparations are underway for abbv-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced parkinson's. we anticipate approval in the first half of next year and believe abbv-951 has the potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. so overall, i'm very pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. and with that, i'll turn the call over to tom for additional comments on our r&d programs.
tom?
tom hudson -- senior vice president, research and development and chief scientific officer
thank you, jeff. in the area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving fda approval for rinvoq in non-radiographic axial spa and positive chmp opinion for skyrizi in crohn's disease. these developments demonstrate the continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. in the quarter, we also saw longer term data from our phase 2 study for rinvoq in systemic lupus, where strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment.
based on these results, we plan to advance rinvoq development in this indication and will be discussing our phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in the coming months. now, i would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. we recently began a phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our ripk1 inhibitor, abbv-668. this small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing tlr4-driven inflammation.
this could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. we look forward to providing updates as data mature. turning now to abbv-154, our anti-tnf steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. we recently completed the primary analysis for the phase 2 dose-ranging study in ra patients.
the hypothesis for this program was that by delivering the steroid directly to the site of inflammation, you could drive higher rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. in this study, all doses of abbv-154 met the primary endpoint of acr50, as well as the majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. at the medium and high doses, abbv-154 delivered acr scores that are similar to rinvoq or slightly better, which validates the platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. the safety profile for abbv-154 was generally consistent with the safety profile for adalimumab.
as part of our safety assessment in this study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. the data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at the higher exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. given the number of effective therapies available in ra and a more limited use of steroids in these patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for the ra indication. however, we continue to believe abbv-154 has the potential to provide a benefit in other diseases such as pmr and crohn's disease, where steroid use is part of the typical treatment paradigm.
our exploratory phase 2 studies in these two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from the pmr study in 2023 and from the crohn's study in 2024. also in the area of immunology, we recently made the decision to stop the clinical studies and discontinue development for abbv-157, our roryt inverse agonist. this decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. moving now to our oncology portfolio where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline.
we recently submitted our regulatory application in europe and our partner, genmab, submitted an application in the u.s. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large b-cell lymphoma. we're seeking accelerated approval based on the positive phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in this indication where we saw very deep and durable responses in these highly refractory patients. we expect decisions in both u.s.
and europe in 2023. we are also nearing completion of the registrational studies for two additional key programs in our heme/onc portfolio; venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. we remain on track to see results from the phase 3 canova trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near the end of this year. following the event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the first half of next year.
for navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in the first half of next year from both the phase 2 refine and the phase 3 transform-1 trials. results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in the second half of 2023. moving to neuroscience where we have applications under active review for several key assets. we anticipate a decision from the fda in december for vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder.
we believe vraylar has a potential to be an important new therapy in this patient population and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients. we also expect a decision from the fda in the first half of next year for a abbv-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced parkinson's disease. and in the area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both the u.s. and europe for qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in the first half of next year.
if approved, this would be another differentiating future for qulipta as it would be the only oral cgrp approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. this is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. and in eye care, our partner regenxbio recently announced positive interim data from the phase 2, aav8 dose escalation trial for rgx-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of wet amd. rgx-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels.
two pivotal trials evaluating rgx-314 for wet amd using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. so in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2023. with that, i'll turn the call over to rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. rob?
rob michael -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, tom. abbvie's third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio. the continued robust performance from skyrizi and rinvoq are helping offset the impact from higher inflation and the stronger u.s. dollar.
we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. these results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired ipr&d expense. total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. the adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales.
this includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted r&d investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired ipr&d expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted sg&a expense up 20.9% of sales. net interest expense was $497 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. turning to our financial outlook. we are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88.
this earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. we now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions.
we now expect skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. for venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in cll and unfavorable foreign exchange. for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given the impact of higher inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. moving to p&l, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales.
turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. at current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. we expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. this guidance does not include acquired ipr&d expense that may be incurred in the quarter.
finally, abbvie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. we generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of september was $11.8 billion. underscoring our confidence in abbvie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in february 2023. and we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times.
in closing, abbvie's strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in the face of economic pressure. and with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well-positioned to deliver long-term growth. with that, i'll turn the call back over to liz.
