j. t. rieck -- treasurer and vice president of investor relations and financial analysis
thank you and good morning, everyone. our second quarter results were released yesterday evening. the earnings release and updated presentation is posted in the investors section of the flowers foods website. our 10-q was filed with the sec yesterday evening as well. before we begin, please be aware that our presentation today may include forward-looking statements about our company's performance. although we believe those statements to be reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
in addition to matters we'll discuss during the call, important factors relating to flowers foods' business are fully detailed in our sec filings. participating on the call today, we have ryals mcmullian, flowers foods' president and chief executive officer; and steve kinsey, our executive vice president and chief financial officer. ryals,
i'll turn the call over to you.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, j.t. good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our second quarter call. so as we approach the 90-day mark since i took over as ceo, i have been spending a great deal of time visiting with and listening to our team and our customers. now more than ever, building good relationships with our customers is critical. it's really important to me that i fully understand where our customers intend to take their business and that flowers stands ready to support their strategic ambitions with our outstanding brands, our quality and our service. but i think it's equally important for them to hear about where we're headed so that we can work better together toward mutually beneficial outcomes.
visiting with our team members has given me the opportunity to hear about what's most important to them, where they think our challenges and opportunities lie and how they'd like to see the company develop going forward. it's also given me the chance to reinforce our strategic priorities with them and help to ensure that we're all moving together in the same direction. as i visited several plants and markets, i've conducted a couple of townhall meeting so far with more to come in the next few months, and i'm very pleased to say that our team is energized and they're eager for what the future holds. they believe at our strategic direction and they're anxious to contribute their part toward that mission. so in short, this intentional and heightened level of engagement with our team has been very positively received.
one of the key messages i've tried to consistently communicate is that it's crucial for all of us to constantly seek out opportunities to improve our business and to execute daily on our strategic priorities. that means not only relying upon our team's years of experience, but also asking different questions in the search for creative new answers. it also means that although we're focused on the long-term earnings power of the company, we must always keep our current results front and center so we have a clear understanding of progress toward our goals. so in the spirit of that message, we're going to shake things up a little bit this morning and start by having our cfo, steve kinsey, review this quarter's results and share our outlook for the balance of the year.
hopefully, that will help to better set the context for my commentary about our operations and strategic priorities. and of course, after our remarks, we look forward to answering your questions. steve?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
thank you, ryals, and good morning, everyone. during q2, we continue to experience solid performance on the top line driven primarily by sales in the retail channel. in the second quarter, consolidated sales increased $34.5 million or 3.7% year-over-year. canyon bakehouse, our recent acquisition, contributed 1.9%. in the base business, improved price/mix drove 1.9% of the sales increase, while slightly lower volumes impacted the top line by 10 basis points. price realizations improved across most of our channels and product classes, which has helped us to partially offset the commodity, labor and transportation cost increases we've highlighted in recent quarters. volumes were primarily impacted in our foodservice and cake businesses. looking at sales by channel, branded retail sales increased $25.8 million or 4.6%.
the contribution of canyon bakehouse branded products accounted for approximately half of these incremental sales dollars. the balance was largely driven by continued growth from dave's killer bread, nature's own and wonder products and the introduction of sun-maid breakfast bread in the third quarter last year. this growth was partially offset by softer volumes in our branded cake items. store branded retail sales increased $15.4 million or 10.5%. store branded items produced by canyon accounted for about 1/3 of this increase. the balance of the growth was split between the group pricing and volume growth due to increased distribution. store brand as a category continues to post volume declines. foodservice and other nonretail sales decreased by $6.8 million or 2.9%. lower volumes drove most of the decline due in part to lost business from the inferior yeast disruption we experienced last year and volume losses in the vending channel of our nonretail cake business.
in the quarter, gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 47.9%. improved price realization did address import cost inflation to some extent, but pricing actions were offset by higher workforce costs and lower manufacturing efficiencies. excluding the items affecting comparability detailed in the press release, adjusted sd&a expenses decreased 20 basis points as a percentage of sale primarily due to lower distribution fees and legal fees as a percent of sales, offset by higher workforce costs in our shipping department and bad debt expense. gaap diluted eps for the quarter was $0.25 per share. excluding the items affecting comparability detailed in the release, adjusted detailed eps in the quarter was flat compared to the prior year. our sales were largely offset by overhead labor cost and reduced manufacturing efficiencies. canyon bakehouse was accretive to ebitda and neutral to eps in the quarter.
a few comments on leverage and cash flow. year-to-date, we've generated operating cash flows of $208.1 million and made capital expenditures of $47.4 million. accordingly, free cash flows were solid, and we paid $79.6 million in dividends to shareholders and reduced our total indebtedness by $86.8 million. at quarter end, our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda stood at approximately 2.1x. now turning to guidance. for 2019, we continue to target sales growth in the range of 2% to 4%. this includes canyon bakehouse sales, which are anticipated to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million, accounting for approximately 1.8% to 2% of the total sales growth.
we expect base business growth to be driven by improvements in price/mix, partially offset by a conservative view on volumes due to broader category softness. we now expect adjusted eps in the range of $0.94 to $0.99 per share. inflationary pressures from commodities, labor and transportation are expected to be approximately 150 basis points as a percent of sales. to mitigate these costs, we are working on a broad set of cost savings and productivity initiatives as well as continuing to elevate, evaluate pricing and promotional strategies market by market. we expect canyon bakehouse to be accretive to ebitda and neutral to slightly dilutive to full year eps.
now i will turn the call back to ryals.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. so i want to put my comments this morning on the quarter into the context of our 4 strategic priorities to create shareholder value. so as a reminder, they are very simply focusing on our brands; managing our costs; making smart, disciplined acquisitions; and developing the capabilities of our team. i believe our results this quarter demonstrate that the focus we're putting on our brands is working. our dollar share of the fresh package bread category increased by nearly a full share point driven by our key national brands, new product introductions and incremental share from canyon. our unit share also increased as well by 50 basis points, and in fact, we gained dollar share in every segment except there in breads and rolls, which, as many of you know, is a small part of our total business.
and importantly, we were able to achieve these results despite higher prices and less promotional activity. so i believe that these results are a great testament to our new strategies, our capabilities, our brands and, of course, our team. we're hyper focused on taking what's already a strong brand portfolio and making it even more powerful. our new org structure has been a key enabler in this regard and our marketing, consumer insights and brand teams are working with our new ad agency to connect more meaningfully with the consumers. we're also gaining greater insight into how our consumers perceive our brands and how to keep them relevant not only today, but going forward in the future. so as a result, we're thrilled with our marketing and innovation pipeline and we believe we're taking the right steps to build strong national brands. in other parts of the portfolio, the refocus on profitability is well under way.
in our cake business, lower sales was a result of a very competitive landscape, but also from planned portfolio optimization. and the good news here is that we're beginning to see some margin improvement in parts of the cake business. and while we certainly have more to do to improve profitability, we are encouraged by the progress we made and we're optimistic about the new product introductions that we have slated for the back half of '19 and beyond to reap nice top line. our foodservice business is being pressured by both difficult year-over-year comparisons as certain foodservice customers discontinue limited-time product offerings and, of course, the business lost to last year's yeast issues. but foodservice remains a vitally important part of our business despite the focus on brands, so we're taking this opportunity to prioritize those customers and product lines that value our high product quality, our broad scale and our unique distribution capabilities.
now despite the good top line performance, the inflationary pressures we continue -- and continue to experience do underline the need for us to aggressively manage cost, and that's why it's one of our 4 strategic pillars. i don't view managing cost as a tactical exercise designed to manage quarterly results, rather, i believe it should be embedded into our strategic framework to ensure that we're correctly positioned to achieve our goals and free up resources for growth. the pricing and promotional actions we've taken so far this year have helped to address a portion of these inflationary headwinds without checking the good momentum we're seeing on the top line. since the start of project centennial, we've had our entire operation under the microscope, looking for ways to remove complexity and generate cost savings.
furthermore, enhanced analytical capabilities have given us greater transparency into our business and are informing better strategic decision-making. so we've had good success with this effort, and we've reduced cost in many areas of our operations and we've been able to reinvest some of those savings into building the new capabilities i mentioned earlier, which are essential for enhancing our growth profile. but make no mistake, we have invested in the business, and this does come with a near-term cost. many of you will remember originally the plan was to reinvest a portion of our centennial savings back into the business and then let the remainder fall to the bottom line. however, greater-than-anticipated cost increases have offset some of those remaining savings, and so we've not yet been able to fully realize our earnings potential. so in short, one could argue that we're a little heavy on cost due to those investments.
now the easy course of action would be to cut costs in those areas, but that would amount to cutting capabilities, which, in turn, would come at the expense of future growth. we believe firmly this is a temporary imbalance and that it will right itself over time as we grow our top-performing brands and achieve greater efficiency. but in the meantime, we are working the current opportunities we've identified to drive down costs in other areas. specifically, we're focused on improving workforce productivity and manufacturing efficiencies, which has been impacted by a tight labor market and increased turnover. now for this sort of situation, there's no quick fix, but we know the steps that need to be taken to address the root causes and enable our team to reach their full potential.
in addition, our team is intensely focused on removing complexities from our supply chain by optimizing the portfolio, shifting production measures and rationalizing capacity. a recent example of this is the conversion of a conventional bread line in the northeast to produce dave's killer bread products. this not only improves service and availability to the northeast market, but also significantly reduces transportation costs and complexity and we intend to take similar network-optimizing actions as we go forward. now given the relatively high fixed cost nature of our supply chain and the innate complexity that comes along with the perishability of our dsd products, we are taking a prudent, data-driven approach to these initiatives. we believe the impact of this work can be significant, but because we're taking a cautious approach, it will take some time to see effect of these efforts in our financial results. acquisitions.
acquisitions have always played a large role in our growth story, and the same will be true going forward. as we said for a while now, we're looking into areas of the store outside the traditional bread aisle as well as different product segments that we believe we have the right to win. and you've seen us do that recently with the acquisition of dave's and canyon bakehouse. we've got an attractive pipeline of potential opportunities, and we are being proactive in the m&a market. importantly, i am pleased to announce that we've recently hired a new vp of corporate development who will be taking over for me and continuing to drive our m&a efforts. this gentleman brings more than 18 years of experience in m&a, 13 of which were spent with another large cpg food company. he's set to start in september, and i'm really looking forward to the value he can bring to flowers.
finally and i think most importantly, it's imperative that we continue to develop the capabilities of our team to bring forth that heightened level of engagement and greater achievement. our goal is to build a team that can bring a fresh perspective to our business challenges and pursue creative solutions. so we'll do this by investing in the tools and information they need to do their job better whether that's faster, more efficient or deeper insight. we're also working to modernize our benefits packages to be more competitive. if you think about it, not only has the business landscape radically changed but so has the workforce, both in composition and what they seek in their careers.
today, it's not just the paycheck they receive that's important, but also the quality of life that comes with it. so in short, we're moving ourselves closer to the desires and needs of today's workforce to make flowers an even better place to build a career. and so with that, we will turn it over to your questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from amit sharma from bmo capital markets. please go ahead
amit sharma -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi good morning everyone.ryals, these are very interesting changes that you outlined. can you dig into that a little bit? like what prompted -- i don't want to call it a reaping, but what prompted this deeper dive into it and how quickly you think it can lead to a, maybe, at least a restatement of how you think about the growth outlook on the longer term.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
amit, are you thinking specifically about supply chain or...
amit sharma -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
supply chain and the way you think about how flowers is positioned as you think about your cost structure or investment on key brands.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no. absolutely. i appreciate the question. well, look, i mean obviously focusing on our brands is a key priority. we have some of the top-performing brands in the country and the more -- that's where the margin of the business come from. the more resources and talent we can put behind those brands, whether it's through our new bu structure and our brand teams that are intensely focused on those brands, that's what gives us good confidence in our growth. and then supplementing that with smart m&a, you can think about the additions of dave's killer bread and canyon really being able to enhance our growth profile, also gives us confidence. on the cost side of the equation, it really comes down to a couple of things. it comes down to labor.
certainly, there's some transportation cost in there, too, but let's primarily talk about labor here. not only is the cost of labor up, but with a tight labor market that, frankly, everyone's experiencing, that manifests itself into higher turnover, which in turn manifests itself into lower efficiencies. you're constantly turning over people at the bakeries. you tend to have higher staff costs at the company. so getting control of that and doing it both from a quantitative standpoint but also from a qualitative standpoint. that's why i talked a lot about the workforce and how can we improve scheduling and working conditions. and it's not just all about pay, it's the benefit packages and quality of life. those are the types of things that, if this tight labor market's going to continue, we're going to have to do to make our operations more efficient.
amit sharma -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then a little bit technical. one of your largest competitors, they talked about being maybe a little bit more focused on pricing to stem the volume losses or share losses. can you talk about that a little bit in terms of how or what are you expecting in the marketplace and how are you positioned if you do see pricing environment get a little bit more promotional?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i -- first of all, i think that's where some of our new analytical capabilities really come into play because we're in a position now where we can annualize where we are from a pricing standpoint market by market. nothing has really changed there in the sense that, that still tends to be a bit of a market-by-market business, but i think we're better positioned now to make the correct decisions as we go forward. as far as flowers specifically goes, we've been very pleased. we took some pricing actions last year. we've been very pleased with how our volumes have held up. we did a little less promotion on branded buns during the holidays, and again, we're very pleased with our volumes held up. so, so far, things have gone pretty well in that regard.
amit sharma -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and just one very quick for steve. steve, can you remind us of your hedging positions on the wheat cost? and then recently, there's some chatter that the protein quality of the red winter may not be quite as good. can you think about -- can you just talk about how it impacts your cost going forward?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
yes. sure. if you recall, we basically use a hedging strategy to mitigate wheat and flour costs. so we are well within our strategy of hedging 4 to 7 months and we typically are on the long end of that. so for 2018, we pretty much have our cost structure in place, so we feel pretty confident about overhead costs for -- i mean, sorry, 2019. you are right. there -- the new crop is coming in, there is some protein concerns. just like last year, you had a lower protein quality crop, which means, eventually, you'll have to blend that with higher spring wheat, which specifically runs a little higher, but that will be a -- we'll begin to talk about 2020 guidance later in the year, but for 2019, we feel pretty good about where we are from a cost perspective.
amit sharma -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
thank you.

our next question comes from bill chappell from suntrust. please go ahead
bill chappelle -- suntrust -- analyst
thanks. good morning, steve, kind of following up on amit's questions. ryals, are you pleased with kind of where the cost structure is at this point, with where project centennial is at this point and kind of what it's doing to quarterly numbers? just i say that as i think some of us as we've now got 3, 4 years into the program, would have expected a little more upside, both to the quarter and to the year, on the cost structure. and i know that's been kind of the key thing you've been working on prior to taking over the ceo role. so maybe kind of help us understand, do you feel like you're going fast enough, do you feel like things need to accelerate or are you just -- is this kind of where you expected to be?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
well, it's kind of a tricky question to answer in the sense that as far as centennial goes, yes, i am pleased. i think we've made tremendous progress with centennial. what i'm not pleased about is the fact that we haven't been able to drop as much as we originally anticipated to the bottom line. i mean centennial fundamentally changed how we operate the company, how we look at the business, and i think those things put us in good stead for the longer term. but the frustrating piece is some of this cost inflation that we're having to deal with now that kind of offset, if you will, some of the savings that we were able to generate.
as to whether things are going fast enough, things never go fast -- as fast as you want them to. you always wish that you could do things quicker. i said earlier that with regard to the supply chain optimization piece in particular, we are being intentionally cautious there. we have a high fixed cost network. we've got to be very careful about how we make choices around our network and what types of business we want to be in, what types we don't want to be in. but overall, centennial itself, yes, i am pleased. but again, the frustrating part is the lack of readthrough to the bottom line that we're trying to address now.
bill chappelle -- suntrust -- analyst
does there need to be another centennial plus just because i guess this is now the second year where costs have more than masked the centennial benefits.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we have very structured formal initiatives around our labor costs, around supply chain optimization. now we're not ladened with consultants like we were when we were undergoing centennial, but we learned a lot from going through that process as to how to structure disciplined initiatives around the 3 topics. so that's how we're handling those pieces going forward.
bill chappelle -- suntrust -- analyst
got it. and last one for me just on canyon. any kind of update on where you are on the fresh or, i mean, the flack out version of the product kind of acv there?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. the stay fresh, yes. so canyon, overall, is doing great. i mean they've got a fantastic team out there, totally engaged. they're excited. the business is performing extremely well. the frozen side of the business is actually exceeding our expectations. the stay fresh piece is slightly behind our expectations. and bill, most of that has to do with consumer awareness. a lot of gluten-free shoppers aren't necessarily accustomed to shopping gluten-free bread in the bread aisle, and so it's taking us a little bit longer than we expected to draw them in, right? but having said that, we are growing the stay fresh business and not only is our acv growing, but so are our terms in the store.
bill chappelle -- suntrust -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from tim ramey from pivotal research group. please go ahead.
tim ramey -- pivotal research group -- analyst
thanks so much, first is sort of more a comment than a question because i know you can't answer it, but your payout ratio is 78%, 79% right now, which i hear what you're saying about wanting to refocus the company on growth, but that's a super high payout ratio for a company that would like to grow and do acquisitions as you mentioned. so just a comment that it seems like that's something that ought to be addressed by the board. where do you want to be, do you want to be a yield stock or do you want to be a growth stock.
and then to throw a question on that, since i know you can't comment, the cost issues that you're discussing are not that unusual, i don't think. and we've seen this pattern several years in a row where you'll raise prices early in the year and then not get the volume and become sort of a negative spiral in the second half of the year. how is this different from what we've seen in the last two or three years?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. well, first of all, as i said earlier, maybe one of the things that makes us different is, as i said, we did take some pricing action in the back half of last year and we've been very pleased with how our volumes have held up. our brands are continuing to perform well. dave's, canyon, nature's own, wonder, they're all performing very nicely, and so i think that differentiates it, perhaps, from years past.
tim ramey -- pivotal research group -- analyst
okay. does that mean you feel ok about taking further pricing on the second half? because i thought i sensed some hesitancy on that.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not going to comment on future pricing.
tim ramey -- pivotal research group -- analyst
okay. thanks for your help
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
thank you, our next question comes from mitch pinheiro with sturdivant company. please go ahead.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i can. i had several good visits with some key retail partners. i think the one constant among them is they're really looking for innovation in the fresh bread aisle. i mean you see the same category trends that we do, the sort of the softness in that, traditional soft variety category. i think their hunger is really around new innovations, and we've certainly given them some of that, between dave's and canyon and perfectly crafted, but i think they'd like to see more of that. there's quite a few consumers that have turned to the perimeter of the store. they're seeking pitas and buns and sort of nontraditional-type flatbreads, that sort of thing. i think they'd like to see flowers bring more of that their way.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
and so i'm hearing -- you've mentioned the cost inflation throughout the call, and it's pretty evident. i mean your margins are nice, but there's certainly room for improvement here. with all your competitors facing the same exact challenges and here's the chance for the supermarket, the grocery industry to raise the value of the category. i don't see what the pressure is on pricing. i mean it just seems to me, with a consumer that is seemingly in ok shape from what we hear, i just don't understand why pricing isn't a little more robust across the entire category. can you talk about that?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, i mean, again, i'm not going to comment on future pricing, but i think, for us, ensuring that we're bringing consumers good value, good brands, good quality and the retailers good service is primarily our focus. we'll worry about the rest as it comes along. that's really our focus, mitch. we believe we've got the best quality. we think we have the best brands, and we think we have the best service. and we've got to continue to be that way to protect our brand -- the brand equity that we have.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
okay. and then a couple -- just a couple others. regarding your store branded sales, they were up in the quarter. i was surprised that there's gluten-free store brand items. usually, innovation is left to the brands and private label store brands take up the more commodity piece of the category. what -- is there a change here?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
no, no. not at all. as a matter of fact, that's with one particular retailer for canyon and it came with the acquisition, so to speak. they have had that business for quite a long time. it's primarily just one retailer.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
okay. got it. and then when it comes to private label, any change in pricing on the private label side?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
we took some pricing last year, mitch. so yes.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
okay. and then last question on tastykake. i haven't -- you don't really break out brands in that area and how they're doing. but obviously, i see the cake sales have been pressured. is it in that mrs. freshley's side, is it tastykake, is it both? and what's -- when do we start seeing -- i know it seems like things were getting better in this quarter, but when do you start -- when should we start anticipating some upside there?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
it's really in both. and again, some of that is due to the competitive nature of that category and our -- frankly, our relative brand positioning there, but some of it is also intentional. we were -- we've got rid of some really low-margin business to turn our attention back to where we can make better margin. and as i said upfront, we've started to see some progress on the margin side of the equation. and then over the top of that, we had some innovation and new product offerings slated for the back half and then forward that we think will help reignite that top line.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
okay. i guess one more, just a follow-up to tim's question about the dividend versus growth. when i calculate your free cash flow, it's fairly robust even, let's say, after dividends. i'm not sure why investors would think that flowers couldn't be a growth company while paying a dividend. can you speak to that?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
this is steve, mitch. i mean i would agree with your assessment. when you look at our overall capital allocation and you look at free cash flow, it continues to be a business that just drives very strong free cash flow. so we believe, with the right balance, that we can continue to pay a nice dividend as well as fund future growth within the company.
mitch pinheiro -- sturtevant company -- analyst
thanks for your time
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
thank you.

our next question comes from brian holland from d.a. davidson. please go ahead
bryan holland -- da davidson -- analyst
thanks. good morning gentlemen first question, and forgive me, i hopped on a little bit late, so apologies if you addressed this at all. but just curious, buns and rolls selling season around the 4th of july, weather seemed a little bit not in your favor. but just curious if there's any call outs there and if there was any -- in consideration of where you came in on revenue, was there a little upside left on the table if indeed weather was a call out at all?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. brian, its ryals. both of the holidays i would describe as good, but not great, some of that was certainly due to the weather. but the good part about it is our sales execution this year was outstanding, particularly compared to last year. i mean the sales team did a great job, our stales were way down. so that sales performance was way up. our partnership with the uso on the wonder bun promotion was fantastic, and so overall, it was a success.
bryan holland -- da davidson -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then on the margin side, it's been my experience that, with your business, it's fairly easy, all things being equal, for pricing to flow right through the model. clearly, that didn't happen this time around. and i understand about the brand investment, but i feel like that was part of the -- that was in the plan. so if i got this right, i'm thinking that higher labor particularly was the incremental -- is that -- so i guess what i'm asking is did labor get sequentially worse and is that the primary call out for why the pricing didn't flow through? or is there another piece of this equation that i'm leaving out here?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
no. i think that's the primary issue. and again, it's labor -- it's the pure labor cost, but then it's also the high turnover, and that tends to come out in manufacturing efficiencies, which were lower for the quarter, and that has impact as well.
bryan holland -- da davidson -- analyst
okay. right. so understood. so then do i have that right then that, that has gotten sequentially worse, like q1 to q2?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
yes. i mean q2 was slightly down compared to q1. typically, you'll see pretty strong efficiency performance in q1, but it did fall off more than usual in q2 this year.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
bryan holland -- da davidson -- analyst
understood. and so then if we play this forward, obviously, gross savings through 2018 had come in ahead of plan -- you couldn't have calculated the magnitude of labor impact. obviously, freight was another issue since you instituted centennial. i'm just curious, is there an -- i mean the next part that's out there, and it seems to be around supply chain optimization, i understand that you can't quantify this, but do you have something still left in the bag that you feel like is a significant sort of catalyst for the trajectory of what we're seeing on margins in excess of what you've already gotten thus far?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
i do. and think about it kind of in 3 buckets. one, obviously, maintaining the top line is paramount, right? that means making sure we're supporting our brands properly. we keep that good branded growth, that we're focusing on the right kind of sales, which means the higher margin type products. and then that then brings in number two, portfolio optimization. right? making sure that our mix is correct. and then, three, maximizing that plant level efficiency, and that's primarily the labor issue. and then extending that a little bit into broader supply chain optimization, that's a little bit longer term. as i said, that will take us a little while to do, we've got to be very careful there. but those are the things that give me confidence that we can reach our long-term margin targets.
bryan holland -- da davidson -- analyst
okay. and then last question for me just kind of on the m&a front. you've done a really good job with dave's killer bread. obviously, canyon seems like another great opportunity maybe potentially smaller magnitude, but still same really exciting opportunity share growth, etc, and you're doing a great job of identifying these niches. i guess two questions. one, when you start thinking about particular niches, is there one that stands out as attractive to you that's a hole in your portfolio, not speaking to any specific asset that may or may not be available?
and then second, kind of the quality of assets, high level, that are within the parameters of where you'd be looking, valuation, availability, attractiveness. just general thoughts on what that pipeline looks like today. and maybe your readiness and maybe to put another way, i mean, obviously, you made the canyon bakehouse acquisition late last year. what is the appetite and what is your ability to digest something else in the near term, while you integrate canyon, get it on dsd and also think about continuing to attack the supply chain pressures?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so i don't really want to comment on specific niches or categories that we're looking at because i really don't want to tip my hand there, but suffice it to say that we have a really good pipeline. as i said in the opener, we are continuing to be really proactive in the m&a market, so what i mean by that is we're reaching out instead of just relying on inbounds, as we used to be able to do when we were just looking inside the core business. so i'm really happy with our pipeline. and i don't -- brian, i said -- i think you said you joined late. look, you heard me say that we've hired a new vp of corporate development who's going to continue to drive this.
so i'm really, really happy about that as well. as far as our ability to digest, i mean i don't want to intimate that any integration is easy, but canyon is one plant. it's in colorado. we basically integrated that already. our sales team knows how to roll out items, dsd. so i mean we are positioned when the right opportunity comes along.
operator
that concludes the q&a session. i will now turn the call over to ryals mcmullian for closing comments.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. so in summary from this morning, while we definitely have some opportunity in front of us, overall, i'm pleased with the actions we've taken so far to improve our performance. with a focus on brands, we're working to maintain our solid top line momentum, and then coupled with that, we're zeroed in on a few specific areas of cost containment where, if we can execute well, should put us on a solid path to continued bottom line improvement and enhanced shareholder value. so thank you for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in flowers foods.

welcome to the flowers foods, third quarter 2019 results conference call, and webcast. my name is paulette, and i will be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions].
i will now turn the call over to j.t. rieck, treasurer and vice president of investor relations. you may begin.
j.t. rieck -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, paulette, and good morning everyone. our third quarter results were released yesterday evening. the earnings release and our quarterly slide presentation is posted in the investors section of the flowers foods website. our 10-q was filed with the sec yesterday evening as well. before we begin please be aware that our discussion today may include forward-looking statements about our company's performance. although we believe those statements to be reasonable they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. in addition to matters, we will discuss during the call important factors relating to flowers foods' business are fully detailed in our sec filings.
with that, i'll make some introductions. participating on the call today we have ryals mcmullian, flowers foods' president and chief executive officer; and steve kinsey, our vice -- our executive vice president and chief financial officer.
ryals, i'll turn the call over to you.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, j.t. good morning and welcome to our third quarter call. we are very happy today to report record sales ahead of our forecast and reiterate our outlook for fiscal 2019 adjusted eps. regarding our four strategic pillars: focusing on our brands prioritizing margin pursuing smart m&a and developing our team we are pleased to see good momentum in several of them. we continue to make nice progress growing our portfolio of top brands. the dkb and canyon acquisitions have been resounding successes. and although it's harder to see from a quantitative standpoint we are doing some great things for the development of our team. but as we said in yesterday's release we are still facing some margin headwinds.
after five months as ceo, i've had the opportunity to assess where we are and what we need to do to improve our profitability while maintaining the great top line momentum we have enjoyed this year. and i'm looking forward to sharing that with you on the call today. however, before i do that like we did last quarter i want to call on steve kinsey first to review the financial results and give our outlook for the remainder of the year to set the context for what we will talk about in a few minutes. then, of course, we will take your questions.
steve?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
thank you, ryals, and good morning everyone. in the third quarter, we continued to experience solid performance on the top line driven primarily by sales in the retail channel. consolidated sales increased $43.1 million or 4.7% year-over-year. canyon bakehouse acquired in late 2018 contributed 2.2%. in the base business improved price mix drove 2.1% of the sales increase while higher volumes benefited the top line by 40 basis points. price realization has improved across most of our channels and product classes which has helped to partially offset the commodity labor and transportation cost increases we have experienced in recent quarters. overall volume performance in our key brands and store brands was strong. however, we did see lower volumes of foodservice and store-branded cake and breakfast items. looking at sales by channel. branded retail sales increased $36.7 million or 6.7%. canyon bakehouse-branded products accounted for slightly half -- less than half of these incremental sales dollars. the balance was largely driven by continued growth from dave's killer bread and nature's own and sun-maid breakfast breads which were introduced in the third quarter of last year.
branded retail cake was flat as compared to the prior year. store-branded retail sales increased $12.1 million or 8.7%. slightly less than half of the sales increase is attributed to the acquired canyon bakehouse store brand business. the balance of the growth was split between improved pricing mix and volume growth in store-brand bread buns and rolls due to increased distribution with existing customers offset by lower volumes at our store-branded breakfast business. foodservice and other nonretail sales decreased by $5.7 million or 2.4%. lower volumes drove most of the decline due in part to lost business from the inferior use disruption in 2018 and volume losses in the vending channel of our non-retail cake business. as we lap these prior year events we expect our foodservice and nonretail business to stabilize. in the quarter gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 47.3% of sales. improved price realization did somewhat help to offset input cost inflation to some extent. however, the benefit of these pricing actions was offset by higher workforce costs and lower manufacturing efficiencies. third quarter gross margins were also temporarily impacted by start-up costs related to the introduction of a new product line at one of our bakeries.
excluding the items affecting comparability detailed in the press release adjusted sd&a expenses increased 60 basis points as a percent of sales primarily due to the timing of employee incentives and increased marketing costs. these items were partially offset by lower distribution -- lower distributor distribution fees which decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of sales and stabilizing logistics cost as a percentage of sales. gaap diluted eps for the quarter was $0.20 per share. excluding the items affecting comparability detailed in the release adjusted diluted eps in the quarter was $0.22 per share down $0.01 compared to the prior year. higher sales were largely offset by elevated labor costs higher marketing expenses and reduced manufacturing efficiencies. canyon bakehouse was accretive to both ebitda and eps in the quarter. shifting to leveraging cash flow just a few comments. looking year-to-date we have generated operating cash flows of $278.1 million and made capital expenditures of $70.6 million. accordingly, cash flows year-to-date have been solid and we paid $119.8 million in dividends to shareholders and reduced our total indebtedness by $102.5 million. at quarter end our net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted ebitda stood at approximately 2.1x.
now turning to guidance. for the remainder of fiscal 2019, we expect good top line momentum so we are increasing our outlook for full year sales growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. this includes sales from the acquisition of canyon bakehouse which now is anticipated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million accounting for approximately 2% of the total 2019 sales growth. we expect base business growth to be driven by improvements in price mix partially offset by a conservative view of volumes due to broader category softness. we continue to expect adjusted eps in the range of $0.94 to $0.99 per share. the pricing actions we have taken now help to mitigate input cost inflation but we expect the margins will continue to be pressured as we work through manufacturing inefficiencies and higher workforce costs because of the tight labor market. we are pleased that canyon bakehouse is performing at the upper end of our plan and we now see it being slightly accretive to full year eps.
now i'll turn the call back to ryals.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve, so look although there were some issues that affected the quarter the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. we have got a solid foundation to build upon. and while there are certainly areas for improvement i believe the trajectory of the business is quite positive. our branded retail business is thriving and we believe this is largely attributable to the org changes put in place a couple of years ago and the resulting focus and higher marketing support for our high-potential national brands: nature's own dave's killer bread wonder all are significantly driving our top line and all three gained unit and dollar share in the quarter as they have each quarter this year. also in the third quarter, dkb became the #2 specialty loaf in retail dollars and canyon bakehouse became the #1 gluten-free bread brand in the country and it continues to grow in distribution and velocity. furthermore, our focus on omnichannel is starting to pay off. in fact, syndicated data shows us that e-commerce sales of fresh-packaged bread buns and rolls have almost doubled in the last year.
and, our branded sales have increased by 55%. that's still a relatively small base but establishing a presence for our brands on the digital shelf is critical for growth in the future as more households buy groceries online and home delivery expands. having said that we recognize there's room for improvement and we still have work to do to improve our margin performance. so over the past several months, i've taken the time to evaluate our current situation and challenge our senior leadership team. working collaboratively we have honed our focus around the issues we face. we have better framed the questions we need to be asking ourselves and focused on the development of a solid plan of action all within the context of our four strategic pillars. so we have identified the three primary areas that we believe will drive the most meaningful margin improvement. one is portfolio and supply chain optimization. look we need to identify the optimal mix of products for flowers so we can drive out complexity and determine the most efficient bakery and logistics footprint. now the other two areas i'll talk about in a minute. certainly, have independent scopes of opportunity but they too will be informed by the halo of this portfolio and supply chain initiative. secondly, it's no secret we have been challenged in the cake business.
but, i believe that with the right level of focus on our cake brands plus investments in automation we can turn this business and bring it to more attractive levels of margin contribution. and third, stabilizing and growing our foodservice business. we are one of the largest suppliers of foodservice bakery products in the u.s. and we need to better leverage that scale rebuilds our lost business and focus on our highest margin opportunities. so with regard to portfolio and supply chain optimization. we have told you for a while now that the first stage of centennial focus primarily on indirect costs and org structure and that we will be turning our attention to the supply chain in the second stage. well, we are now at that point. and so we are asking ourselves two fundamental strategic questions: one what's the optimal portfolio for flowers that can promote margin accretive growth?; and two what's the correct network and resources required to support and grow that portfolio going forward? the answer to these questions we are undertaking a complete portfolio profitability review along with the development of tools and capabilities that will allow us to make more informed strategic choices around things like assortment pricing distribution innovation.
it will also help us more efficiently weed out unprofitable products or unprofitable accounts that contribute nothing but added cost and complexity. and it will generate opportunities for supply chain and overhead optimization. so the true crux of this effort is to drive out valueless complexity and improve our operational efficiencies. now we have certainly taken advantage of the immediate opportunities to optimize our network. we have added organic capacity in the northeast this year we announced the closing of our opelika alabama bakery at the end of this year and we installed a new high-speed bun line in suwanee georgia. we also have plans in place to convert another existing flowers bakery to organic production to support the growth of dkb and that will happen next year. but i believe that a holistic approach that's centered around the optimization of the portfolio will generate more meaningful improvements over time. before we formally launched this initiative we did complete an internal review that began when i was coo. i wanted to be sure that we challenge and hone the questions we are trying to answer. so that when work began in earnest we had a very tight focused scope of activities with clearly understood desired outcomes.
the initial phase of this work has already begun. it will take several weeks to complete. it's being directed by a dedicated internal team and we have support from outside resources. and it's our intention to have an update for you on where we are by our earnings call next february. with regard to the second area of focus reinvigorating and investing in our cake business. look it's become clear to me that we have under-invested in our cake brands and operations for several years now. and the recent production difficulties we experienced with that new product launch only serve to shine a brighter light on it. we believe in the potential of the iconic tastykake brand and we will be seeking to make smart investments to drive the brand forward. that means a renewed focus on consistent quality service distribution and innovation. it also means investing in robotics and other automation tools to drive efficiencies and improve our quality. the work on that initiative is already under way. foodservice is our third area of focus. as you know our foodservice business was challenged last year by the yeast disruption. we are now cycling that but more importantly, we need to get our foodservice business growing again.
it's an important and scalable part of our business and i think that working to grow it smartly by winning a good margin business and seeking out attractive m&a candidates that offer margin accretive premium or artisan product lines will be beneficial. so within our four strategic pillars, we will focus on these three areas with intensity and i believe that over time execution against all three will improve our bottom line performance. so moving on m&a. m&a remains a key strategic priority where we have had some recent success. as we mentioned earlier since we closed the deal last september canyon has grown from #3 all the way to #1. on the top line, it's performing at the upper end of our expectations and it's beating our bottom line targets. but as the canyon integration winds down we are continuing to proactively seek strategic opportunities in areas of the store outside the traditional bread aisle as well as different product segments where we believe we have the right to win. as you know we play in a large category so m&a is expected to be a key driver to grow our business and pivot to higher-margin and faster-growing categories within baked foods.
and finally, i firmly believe our most important strategic priority is developing our team members and making sure that our organization possesses the capabilities and tools to successfully execute on all the other priorities we have talked about today. so at all levels of the organization we are increasing communication we are increasing engagement we are aligning work schedules to better fit today's modern lifestyles and we are clarifying career paths to attract the best candidates and improve retention. also, we are increasing accountability and better aligning incentives to job responsibilities. today almost 30% of our employees have incentives that are directly tied to their role. two years ago that number was 0. so i firmly believe that as we continue to link incentives with responsibilities at the functional level execution against our priorities will improve.
so in summary, despite some continuing margin headwinds in a few discrete areas the fundamentals of the business are strong the branded business continues to enjoy good growth our recent m&a successes continue to bring meaningful returns our cash flow and our balance sheet are strong and we have got a talented loyal and dedicated team that executes with excellence. it will take some patience and some time for us to realize the full benefits of our initiatives. but if we can deliver against the three areas of focus i summarized for you today we believe that we can not only continue to drive the top line but also deliver the improved margin performance of which we are capable and that our shareholders expect.
so, now we will turn to your questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we have a question from mitch pinheiro from sturdivant & co. please go ahead, mitch.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant & co -- analyst
good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hi mitch.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant & co -- analyst
so the first question is regarding phase two here of project centennial and the supply chain optimization, i mean -- i know you said something but i missed it in your remarks. but how long is this review going to take? i would have thunk that phase two would have been planned out as phase one is going along. but now that it seems like it's a discrete stop and then start and then you have this phase two analysis and then phase two implementation like what's the timeline on that?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so mitch i mean it's -- the whole thing is kind of the next step in the evolution under centennial right? i mean, we had a we had a lot of org changes that came about in the first phase that we want to make sure we got bedded down and all in place. and all that frankly is settled out now. but i think more importantly mitch, we have been thinking about this for a long time. i mean you know this industry pretty well and this is something you got to be pretty careful and deliberate about. and so we took quite a bit of time to do our internal reviews, and frankly learn quite a bit. and i mentioned in my prepared remarks that one of the reasons we did that is we wanted to come out on the other side of that internal review with a very very detailed and tight scope of work. obviously, for economies, we went through a lot of spend with centennial that won't be repeated here. this is much -- a much smaller scale. but we wanted both our internal and our outside resources to be fully prepared going in on the front end so we could keep that scope really tight clearly understand what outcomes we were after and then perform the formal work.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant & co -- analyst
and when you look at this is there -- are you looking at your portfolio profitability optimization? i mean, is there any -- are we going to see sales being cold in a material way? or i mean would it be a drag on revenue growth in a material way i guess is the question?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean look i mean, there's an element of sku rationalization involved here. obviously, i can't quantify that for you today. that will come later on but it's much more than that. i mean this is a much more holistic approach that is rooted in portfolio optimization but it's also about the network right and making sure that we are operating as efficiently as possible. i mean we will have more details on it as we go through the process and not ready to answer that today. but there will be some element of sku rationalization involved. i mean that's probably pretty obvious.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant & co -- analyst
okay. and then when it comes to the tight labor as it affects efficiency is that the inability to fill second shifts? or can you talk about that a little bit?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes, mitch, it's really turnover. the turnover has been the biggest problem. and to address that we are doing some short-term things. and then obviously the portfolio and supply chain network stuff is a little longer term. but we are trying to do some creative things with scheduling. as a fresh perishable dsd business, we basically run every day and so we don't have the luxury of building inventories and sort of having more predictable scheduling. so we are doing some things with shifts to try to give people more certainty as to their schedule more instances of consecutive days off which is historically a rarity in our industry and just overall trying to make it a more attractive place to work. and furthermore, we are moving back away in some of our plants from outsourced labor back to permit labor to create that more of that one team atmosphere. we have done that in a couple of bakeries so far. and i can't say that we have seen significant financial returns from that yet but we have seen the turnover start to fall. once that happens and takes hold one would expect once those folks are trained up for those manufacturing efficiencies to start coming back up to historical levels.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant & co -- analyst
okay, i will. thank you. i'll get back in the queue.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you mitch.

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from bill chappell with truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
i was kind of struck by in the prepared remarks, the commentary of the growth on wonder bread, i mean almost as fast as dave's killer bread for the year. and so, just trying to understand, i guess, a little more color around that because i would think that i guess, one, that growing faster than nature's own would be a negative hit to price mix, but obviously, you had very good price mix first in the quarter and the year. so, is that just taking share from private label and your store brand sales and so that's really driving it?
is there anything else going on other than kind of a consumer migration up to a branded product -- met more similar price points and how sustainable is kind of the wonder strength as we go into 2021?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, bill. actually, we're very pleased with the wonder growth. most of that is going to be on the bun and roll side, not as much on the bread side, which is exactly what we want to accomplish. i mean, as we've talked about before, we were somewhat behind on our -- our branded bun and roll growth because traditionally, we had kind of a smattering of regional brands, the sunbeams of the world, things like that.
we needed to get aligned behind a national brand to run national programs with national retailers and that's what we've migrated to over the last few years. so, as some of the regional businesses has fallen off intentionally, we've been able to grow wonder quite nicely. so again, most of it's going to be on the bun and roll side and that's quite intentional.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, that's -- that's helpful. and then are you seeing though, i mean in terms of general with the store brands continuing to be weak. do you expect this migration up to more branded products to remain? are you seeing any pulling back of that of consumers kind of going back to their traditional buying habits?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
not yet, not yet. and of course, that's one of the big questions for the year, right. it kind of goes back to the -- to looking at -- at potential mix reversion in total, but the private label trends that we saw in q4, actually if you exclude the 53rd week, private label was actually a little bit worse sequentially in q4 than it was in q3. so, there's been no change in the trend yet, could see some of that later in the year, but obviously our focus is on branded growth, so putting support -- additional support behind brands like wonder and nature's own, canyon, dave's, the rest of them is a key strategic priority for us.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then one last one, steve, i think we're all familiar that when you hear major erp implementation with packaged food company, it's not always a recipe for success. so, i mean, can you just help us understand where the systems are or that process as part of the transformation office and -- and what kind of what you kind of expect to see coming out of that once it's done?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
sure. yeah, i guess, historically, i guess when you hear erp initiative or upgrade, investors get a little bit spooked, but the reality is, i think over the past decade or so you've seen most of these to be very successful. we implemented sap back in '20 -- back in 2000. so, it's been about 20 years and we haven't had or seen any major or significant upgrades within our system. currently, we are on track to keep sap as our overarching erp system and they are in the midst of an upgrade with s/4hana. so basically, we will be falling in line with that.
and so we're in the middle of selecting an implementation partner and after that point, we'll decide, which modules move into a true upgrade. but overall, we feel like with the transformation office and the plan we have laid out, we'll be very mindful and cautious with the approach. so, it's not like we're changing our erp platform, it's really an upgrade of what we currently have.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
and bill, just to add to that, we -- we are pretty early in the process. i mean, we're, as steve said, we're just, just getting the si selected. so, it's early days, but it's also important, you saw in the prepared remarks to remember that this is not solely an it project. this is, but a part of a broader digital strategy and the best way that i think you should think about it is that, particularly the erp upgrade and the rest of the digital strategy are really going to be key enablers to the execution of our broader strategic plan, whether that's brand support or network optimization or plant upgrades.
to be quite frank, from an overall digital standpoint, flowers is behind its peer group and frankly, its competitor. so, this is something that we've needed to do for quite a while. obviously coming off of a very strong year, great cash flows, very strong earnings, this was a great time to make the investment.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
no, i get it. and would we see the benefits this year or that's more next year in terms of some of these efforts?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, very little, but immaterial benefit this year. the investments will come this year, the benefits will follow in '22 and beyond and we will be more specific about that later in the year as the business case comes into clear focus.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great, thanks so much.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer

operator
your next question comes from brian holland from d.a. davidson.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brian.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning, everyone. good morning. so, i wanted to ask about the guide for 2021. i think ryals, in your prepared remarks, you make reference that the guidance is in line with the targets -- with your long-term targets if you use 2019 as the base. so, i guess, i would think that this backdrop would be net favorable. obviously, it was hugely favorable in 2020. obviously mean reversion coming in 2021, but you still have a quarter of -- or at least two months here of what should be a more or less what we've seen in the past several months. and then even if we start to revert back, we still are going to have this mix of more work from home, it will be a progression toward herd immunity, etc.
so, kind of with that as backdrop, i mean, is it as simple as the commodity inflation and the investment in digital are going to be the offsets that keep us in line with algorithm as opposed to maybe saying above algorithm for another year, or if we're going to use the '19 to '21 trajectory, or is there something else we should be thinking about here in the way that you're forecasting out the year?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
no, no, i think you're pretty much spot on. the only thing i would say is maybe a slight correction is the very bottom end of the guidance would be slightly below algorithm balance. also remember, yeah, you've got an estimated nickel of digital investment that we're making this year that does -- that does burn that. we're not adjusting for that, but it is a factor to be considered. but that -- that $1.07 on the bottom end would be slightly below, but again, making the investments to enable us to be within or above algorithm over the longer term and so i'll say that first.
i think that the -- the factors for the year, i think, you've got all of those right. not sure that i would put commodities at the top of that list. i think top of mind for me are two things. when and -- when does the mix reversion happen and to what extent does it happen, right. how deep is that mix reversion back toward, let's call it 2019 levels. i personally don't think it will go all the way back, but i do think that there will be some and the timing of that would impact ultimately where you fall in the range. that's number one.
number two would be the promotional environment. right now in the fourth quarter, things remain stable. i would say the same after five weeks into the -- into the new year, but as we move through the year and things revert back to normal to what extent does the category start to promote more to retain the gains of 2020.

i appreciate the color ryals and if i could just follow-up on that last point. so historically, when i think about this category and i think about the backdrop for flowers foods, intuitively, the logic has been inflation is, is a net positive for flowers because you compete against a disproportionate number of independent bakers who maybe don't use as much forward buying, don't have a sophisticated -- sophisticated hedging practice. so, maybe have to be responsive to higher wheat cost right away, which gives you either the flexibility to take price in kind and realize the higher spread or maybe kind of continue to manage given your hedging that maybe you're going to see that inflation a little bit later. you could be a little bit more promotional and you would take more share.
so, either way you sort of are in a favorable position. i guess, the inverse would be a little bit, would be true as well when we start to see deflation. but, so i guess maybe two things. one, is that an outdated logic as it pertains to the set up, and then two, if it's not, if it's still relevant then how do you think about managing that over the next 12 months? is the focus on volume or is the focus on getting the price through and flowing that through to margins?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let me start, i may ask steve to weigh in here too. no, i don't think it's outdated logic. but i also think it's perhaps not quite as meaningful as it once was given the industry consolidation. i mean, there's just not as many independents as there used to be. right. so, their influence is not quite as great, though it is still there and i think everything you said was accurate. i just don't think it's perhaps as impactful as it was a decade ago.
what i would also say is that and we've seen this throughout 2020 in particular that where we've been able to promote at a higher base price, we're getting more dollar lift from our promotions and i attribute a great deal of that to the capabilities that we built from a price promotion standpoint that we did not have before. in short, we're just a lot smarter about how we promote, where we promote, when we promote and we're able to get a better return on that. and i also think that the overall branded strategy really helps there too. i mean, we're working with really strong brands as you know and i think that goes a long way as well.
steve, anything you want to add to that?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
no, i mean, brian, we stayed pretty true to our philosophy and strategy that's worked i would say, fairly well for us for throughout most of my career. so, to ryals point, we've -- we take coverage in that six to nine-month timeframe and obviously, some years that works well for us, some years as you say, be deflationary and we may recall it, but for the most part for 2021, we feel bit about the coverage we have on and off, we'll see inflation start to ramp somewhat in the late in the second quarter, but then it really picks up in the back half and that's really dependent on how the crops come out. so, there -- while we expect pretty significant inflation back half there may still be few opportunities there.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
understood. and again in your -- appreciate in your prepared remarks from last evening of the way in which you organized a lot of the initiatives and clearly you have a number going on. some may take a little bit longer, some may flow through quicker. one that stands out to me, i don't know if it's my philadelphia roots or maybe just some conversations i've had with you all offline, but really curious about the navy yard and the underperforming snack cake segment for you. if we could just kind of walk through, how quickly we think we can enhance the performance there with the new leadership and maybe a tighter focus on that and kind of what the mechanics are?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, happy to do it. well, i'm pleased to report that we're already making good progress. i mean, the changes that we've made, putting david up there to oversee these efforts, particularly at the navy yard, and frankly, the team that we have there at navy yard, they've really done -- they've really done a great job getting the operation on its way to turning around. we're not there yet, but we're really starting to see some nice progress, we saw it toward the end of the year and that's continued into this year. we have pretty significant target set for them this year, that if they are able to achieve and i have no reason to think they will not. as i've said before, that will be material benefit to the company as a whole, not just navy yard.
i think we've mentioned before, we've upgraded some equipment in that plant, put some capital dollars into it, automated some of the lines, particularly on the -- on the packaging and installed some robotics. that has helped a lot to bring the scrap rates down, which was a major issue there and a large source of the financial difficulties they were having. so, we're definitely on the roll in the path to recovery. we're not there yet, but we expect to see significant improvement there this year.
i'd also mention that we're not just doing things from an operational standpoint talking specifically about navy yard and tasty now, but we're also doing thing all things on the commercial side. simplifying the operations, we are doing skew there. we're focusing on price and promotion to make sure we have all that right. we're getting the required return. so, it's, yeah, it's a combination of -- a combination effort of both operational improvements and commercial improvements.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
appreciate all the color. thank you.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure.

your next question comes from rob dickerson with jefferies.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
morning, rob.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right, great, thanks. good morning. thank you. yeah, so just kind of question on m&a thoughts from here you know obviously, it sounds like you have a few moving pieces occurring this year and going through a larger optimization plan and few strategy, capex is up, but like you said ryals, you ended the year in a great cash position, i think the best ever. leverage seems to be fairly well contained. and then also your eps target, i think long-run relative to sales and ebitda target does include some m&a, right.
so, would you say, hey, given this, do you deem it kind of more of a transition year and kind of where the focus is internally that you may not be in a spot right now to be aggressively pursuing a healthy pipeline of acquisitions or at the same time, could you potentially as an organization, still be active with acquisitions while you're implementing the other pieces of the strategy? that's just the first question. thanks.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, rob, and short answer, i absolutely think we can still be active there. i mean, i think that -- particularly not only have the transformation office setup and with the government -- governance protocols that we have in place to oversee all these strategic initiatives that we're in a better position to be able to flex. so, even if we have to pause something for a moment in order to i mean, m&a opportunities come and you've got to kind of strike while the iron is hot, right. the timing is not necessarily always at your choosing.
but i think we would have -- i think we would have plenty of flexibility to turn our attention to an m&a opportunity should that arise. i'm actually pretty excited about this year from an m&a standpoint. i mean, we are starting to see things begin to heat up again, sort of post -- post-crisis, if you will. a lot of things coming to market, a lot of rumblings about things to come down the road. so, the pipeline remains good. we will remain pretty disciplined about how we approach this, but the opportunities seem like they are -- they are starting to pick back up again.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. and then just quickly and pardon me, if somebody else had asked, i unfortunately hopped on late. in the prepared remarks from yesterday, right, there is a line in there that states kind of, there are optimization savings of $30 million to $40 million. it seems like that's kind of more front-half loaded in the year. so, maybe if you could just -- this is probably for you, steve, just kind of walk through why there wouldn't be incremental optimization savings in the back half of the year. that's one. and then two is, can there be upside from those optimization savings to hopefully potentially partially offset some of the promotional and just overall cost inflation risk later in the year? thanks.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. there are some benefits to the back half. it's just that the majority of them are coming in the first half. and rob, this is basically a continuation of the portfolio optimization savings we got in the back half of last year. it's all the same initiatives on overhead and procurement and all those things we talked about last year. we just start to lap them in the second half of the year, which is why the benefit is not as great.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
sorry, if i could just slide in real one quick last one. it's just on kind of where you've seen the mix of the business go throughout the past whatever 10 months. were there any kind of broad learnings that kind of would make you rethink where you want to play? like that i am assuming you still want to have the capacity come back on some of that foodservice business and some of the private label business. but if it all didn't come back, would that necessarily be a bad thing for flowers, just given what we've seen has happened with price and mix and margins?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
not necessarily, no. look, as we've said, there are certainly pieces of our foodservice business that we really like and then there are some parts that are underperforming and we're working to get those up to snuff. but i think the key learning from 2020 is the power of mix and rob, as we've talked about this was our strategy going into 2020, focusing on -- focusing on brands and trying to get a higher -- a higher mix of branded products in the portfolio, both organically and in future m&a deals.
2020 just really exaggerated that in a very meaningful way. but i think for us, the most powerful thing it did throughout the organization was demonstrate that power of mix to everybody, for me, all the way down to the organization because we are an older company, we've got a lot of long-tenured employees, there was a certain way of thinking here that kind of emphasized volume over value instead of the other way around. this really proved to everybody again, for me, to the distributor partners, to the folks at plants that mix matters and you don't need all that volume if your -- if your mix is positive.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from faiza alwy with deutsche bank.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
morning, faiza.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. so, i was wondering, i guess, a little bit of a follow-up to the last question on, but specifically on dkb and canyon. it strikes me that those are sort of more longer-term growth drivers and i was wondering, how you were thinking about those two brands relative to the rest of the branded portfolio? like is there a scenario where maybe this year those two brands can continue to grow, while you do see mix reversion on the rest of the portfolio? so, just more color around how you were thinking about the various pieces of the branded portfolio this year?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, faiza. well, i mean, it shouldn't come as a surprise that both dkb and canyon are obviously big -- big beneficiaries of our focus. they do continue to grow at a rapid rate. obviously, canyon is a lot smaller, being in a smaller category. i'm happy to report dkb is now over an $800 million branded retail and we just bought them back in 2015. so, the growth has just been -- has been extraordinary. but i'll say again dkb's household penetration is half of nature's own's still. so, there is a tremendous amount of room to continue to grow that awareness and as we grow that awareness, not only do we grow the dkb brand with the product portfolio we have today, but it also gives us a right to expand that product portfolio into potentially even adjacent categories.
so, i think the runway for growth for dave's is tremendous. i similarly think that of canyon, though it is a smaller piece of the pie. i think canyon was around $120 million at retail, jt, this year, so great growth from them too but just on a smaller scale. but i think there is -- there is plenty of opportunity to continue to grow in the gluten-free category as well. canyon has basically doubled its share of the gluten-free bread category to around 34 a share i think at last look, and of course, dkb has a 68 share of the organic bread category. so, we are in a significant position of strength. so, it's incumbent upon us to capitalize on that.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. and i guess, as it relates to m&a focus, has anything, you seem pretty excited about the potential opportunities. can you talk about what would get you most excited? i know at one point you laid out certain categories that you would want to be in. is it sort of brands that are maybe sort of similar to the dkb, canyon, sort of what type of opportunities would you be most excited about?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i can't -- obviously we can't comment specifically on brands. but what i will say is, we would be looking for things that look one, it fit strategically and it fit culturally. i mean. we're always bearing that in mind and obviously, the numbers have to work. so, you have to -- it has to fit financially. but beyond that, we are looking for -- for brands that are growing. we are looking for brands that can be complementary to our existing portfolio and help us grow the overall business and obviously, we're looking for assets that can be margin accretive, even if they're not at the outset, can they be and is there a good plan for them to be in the long term as they scale up and grow.
we have the ability to distribute both dsd and warehouse. so, we're not just limited to dsd even though that is the bulk of our business. warehouse models are certainly -- certainly no issue for us, it's really about, does it fit financially, does it fit operationally, does it fit culturally and does it complement the branded portfolio.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then just last question for steve. i know we've talked a little bit about cost inflation, is there a way to quantify, so how you're thinking about the inflation in the back half, sort of what's embedded in your guidance? and are there sort of any offsets that you are embedding beyond the portfolio optimization savings?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
i mean, we would not give specifics, but when you look at kind of what's happening within the wheat market, which primarily impacts flower, which obviously is our largest input cost. that's where we're seeing the most inflation and historically, when you've had inflation with commodities, you've seen some pricing power. so we would -- we would hope to be able to mitigate -- if it continues to on the trajectory we are seeing now, we would hope to be able to mitigate some of that through pricing. but then also, as ryals mentioned, we still have optimization efforts going on, we're looking at mitigation maybe in other offsets with input costs. but the reality is it looks right now that like most of that inflation has been on hold in the back half.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, thank you so much.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from tim perz with stephens.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
morning, tim.
tim perz -- stephens -- analyst
two question, guys. good morning. so, i just wanted to touch on guidance first, just how are you thinking about the cadence of the return to normal? how should we think about that impact on sales trends? and then, how should we think about the contribution of volume and price mix to your top line sales guidance?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. let me start with the cadence and i'll let steve talk to talk to the mix. look, it's a hard thing to forecast as we all know. but generally speaking, what we've seen so far in the year has been fairly similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. there have not been any major changes yet. however, as you start to approach around week 11 or so, for us, that's when the difficult comps start against the initial surge in demand.
i think the real question is at what point do you get really broad vaccination rollout. i think, one thing that's come out in the last week is, johnson & johnson getting the emergency order for their doses, which would take it up i think to around 600 million doses, which would pretty much do it, right. but how fast is that -- how fast does that get rolled out and at what point do you kind of reach that herd immunity.
the latest things that i'm reading, suggest a q3, q4, you know herd immunity when you reach that but between now and then how quickly do things go back to normal and then the follow-up question is what is normal. what does the new normal look like. is it a full reversion or is it something less than a full reversion. so, we think that things should trend around the same for the first quarter or so and then start to -- start to taper back in the three quarters that follow. so, that's -- that's pretty much what we've built into our -- into our guidance model. but obviously, that's an educated -- educated forecast and not set in stone. we'll just have to -- we'll have to see how it shakes out. i wish i knew, for sure, but frankly, none of us do.
so steve, you want to talk to the mix?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
yeah, i mean, basically, as ryals said, from a reversion and mix perspective, mix has been a strong contributor in 2020. so, as that starts to wane somewhat, as we return to more normalcy that that will drive an impact overall margin. and the way, the kind of the cadence of the guidance is, as ryals said, that really begins to happen in q2 and then moving into back half, but this, it's kind of a jump ball. if -- if we continue to see a lot of in-home feeding continue that will be very, very favorable to the mix but you see a lot of confidence in consumer to start moving about again and dining out and obviously, that will drive the mix reversion back to something pre-2020.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, just to add one more thing to that, tim, i mean, the midpoint of our -- the midpoint of our guidance is above algorithm and as we said, even that midpoint is burdened by our digital investment that we're making this year. so obviously, we're pretty confident in the plans that we have for the year. the bottom end of the guidance, that wouldn't be just a mix reversion. we're being a little bit perhaps cautious coming out of the gate just because of the lack of visibility, but what would get you to the bottom end of the guidance would be sort of all these factors, company get a much higher promotional environment, commodities are a pretty deep, mix reversion, but yeah, the mid to the top of the guidance obviously, reflects our continuing confidence in the strategy of business.
tim perz -- stephens -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and i just wanted to touch on a bigger picture question here. what were the biggest lessons that you've learned over the past year and do you think there is anything structural that you think might make flowers a stronger company coming out of the covid environment?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i do. it's an interesting question. and i think we've already done a lot of it. i mean, we've, as you know, we've reorganized, we've created the chief brand officer position, we've got a new innovation function, we have the transformation office now, we've hired a new supply chain officer. steve has hired a new procurement officer. so, i think we've done a lot of the organizational structure things that we need to do and i feel really good about the team that we have in place. as i say all the time, i think we've got the best team in the industry and i think with the changes that we've made we are even stronger.
as i mentioned earlier, i do think that this demonstration of the power of mix in our business is one of the most powerful things that's happened to the company over the last several years. it's been a learning opportunity for the company. it's allowed us to change the mindset of our -- the -- not only the management team, but the broader organization that focusing on brands and following our portfolio strategy is the right way to go for the long term and i think we can continue to build on that.
tim perz -- stephens -- analyst
all right, thanks guys. i'll pass it along.
operator
your next question comes from mitch pinheiro with sturdivant.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
morning, mitch.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
hi. one question, just or two questions perhaps. the store brands, does this reverse in '21? are we going to see store brands take share or have retailers sort of learned a good lesson during the pandemic that private label just devalues the category?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. you know, it will be interesting to watch how that unfolds. what i would say mitch is that private label was in our category at least was in decline prior to the pandemic. now the pandemic did accelerate that. but we were kind of seeing these trends even prior to 2020. the retailers -- if i were the ceo of a retailer, i would want to give the consumer what they want and consumers are obviously looking for brands.
they are looking forward on the shelf, the physical shelf, they are looking forward on the digital shelf and that's where our focus is. so again, i can't speak to what the retailers might be thinking, but if i was running one of them, i would want to give the consumers what they're asking for.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay. and the second question is, just sort of -- you call out the higher promotional or the potential for higher promotional environment in the back half, you're not seeing it now. you haven't seen it. why would it be a risk? i mean, what would be the and especially in light of maybe higher commodity costs, why would -- is there something that you are anticipating, or is it just calling out, you know, a typical risk for any packaged foods company?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's more of the latter. and certainly, we've heard of the food companies talk about it, some even talk about how they plan to be more promotional this year to keep the share they have gained through the pandemic. so, i think, it's just a watch out. you're right, we haven't seen it yet, but it's just a risk that we have to take into account. should things very quickly revert back to normal, how much more promotional does the category overall get to retain that share and to what extent do we have to participate in that.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay, that's all i have. thank you.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mitch.
operator
your next question comes from ryan bell with consumer edge research.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ryan.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning, everyone. probably not the core focus right now, but could you talk about the foodservice business and your expectation for the recovery over the course of the year?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think the foodservice recovery largely follows the question around what normalization looks like. what extent our restaurants opened back up. new york -- new york starting to slowly open back up but at a very low occupancy level. it really depends on what that trajectory looks like. ryan, the fast food side of the business has performed pretty well actually. i mean, it's been -- it's been up a little bit, it's really still that broadline, sit down fast casual type business that remains under pressure.
if you look at the fourth quarter, again, excluding the 53rd week, foodservice non-retail and other for us, but that includes the foodservice business primarily was slightly better, but no meaningful recovery yet. so, i think, if you were to pin me down, i would say you probably start to see some -- some maybe more meaningful recovery in the foodservice business toward the back half of the year as supposed, i think the front half will tend to be more of the same.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks, that's helpful. and on the innovation front, is there anything that you would have in mind to help retain some consumers? i mean, if you're spending more time at home, it's easier say to justify having a whole loaf of bread versus if you're going to be having more time at the office. what that would mean? so, i mean, maybe innovations such as like half of loaf? any emphasis behind that or anything else that may be you learned, you might want to focus on more coming out of pandemic?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. i don't want to be too specific for obvious reasons, but suffice it to say that we have a pretty significant amount of innovation coming this year. our innovation last year, contributed some $60 million to the top line. so, we've been very pleased with those efforts. i think, the way that we've restructured in the resources, we put behind innovation, will continue to deliver it and hopefully at a faster rate going forward.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and i think the last one for me. could you talk about your expectation for the labor market and workforce cost in 2021? there's been some of the frontline costs that you've had associated with covid. is that -- does that just go away once you have the majority of the workforce vaccinated? how should we think about that?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not sure that some of the cost and safety protocols are going to go away from a long time -- for a long time. i mean, despite everyone being vaccinated, you've got these other variants that are going around, there is probably going to be more of them as we get down the -- as we go down the road side. i personally think that we're going to be living with this in one way or another for quite a long time. what will help though for us is -- let me frame it this way. the biggest issue for us from a labor standpoint in 2020 was the number of people that were out, either because they had contracted covid or because they had come in close contact and we were following our safety protocols and obviously, that, that disrupts our operations and your efficiencies are lower.
i mean, despite our performance in 2020, had the plants been able to operate at the efficiency levels they were capable of it would have been a lot -- it would be -- it would have been even better, significantly better. but you just had, you had so many people out. so, i am looking forward to that calming down. as a matter of fact, we've already seen it calm down. our experience at flowers kind of follows the national trends. the case counts are coming down everything. so, things are already beginning to normalize. we haven't really seen like pure wage inflation. but it's been more of the resulting inefficiencies from folks being out.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst

ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning rob.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
so, q1 was a good quarter, it sounds like you have decent conviction in the revenue guidance plus it sounds like or seems like those consumers that have been consuming at home continue to consume at home with retail brands still elevated, which is great. i would just ask because i think this is kind of the main question for a lot of investors right now. there's a line in the prepared remarks that says, it seems as if maybe commodity inflation is somewhat manageable for this year, but for next year if prices kind of remain where they are, there could be a bit more pressure. so i would just appreciate any more color on that color potentially around some of those offsets including pricing potential in the back half of this year? and then obviously leave it at that. thanks a lot.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
sure rob. hey, this is steve. obviously, there's a lot of volatility in the commodity markets. our guidance takes into consideration what we believe will play out for 2021. and as you know, we do hedge and we take coverage usually on the seven to nine months-time horizon and typically stay on the long end of that. so, we do believe we have good visibility for the rest of 2021.
there are a few things that we can't cover, a little more near-term from some of the packaging area. and you are seeing, a lot of volatility and inflation in packaging, particularly around the corrugated area and arena. but like i say, we do feel like we have decent visibility. ralph[phonetic] said in his comments, there are several levers we can pull, i think being one of those that we are looking at, efficiencies across our bakeries as well as other cost initiatives. so i do feel pretty good about the guidance range we have out there. and, obviously, due to the volatility and the way things moved so quickly, as the year progresses, we'll be able to exchange guidance if necessary but i think given the point we're at we feel pretty comfortable with that.
looking in 2022, obviously, we're not prepared to give guidance for 2022. but the reality is when you look at what's driving kind of the commodity inflation, a lot of that is not necessarily wheat. i mean, the wheat crop is in pretty decent shape, but it's other grains like corn and beans, and it's more of a global market. we are seeing, china back into that market in a big way. and just as grains turn to feed grains and there is tightness on availability of the supply, then that starts to impact things like wheat and other grain crops.
so, the reality is that today's prices, if we had to go out and cover, it would be significant commodity inflation. but we still have a lot of runway with regard to the corn crop, the bean crop. we'll cycle a wheat crop but, we just thought it was important to get that out there from a transparency perspective.

rob, just to add a couple of points to that, steve is spot on across the board, but we've -- as you know we've been through periods like this many times in the past and we've been able to adequately cover most of the inflation that we've experienced over the years. i would say that i think we're better positioned today, perhaps, than we've ever been. just with the -- if you think about the strength of our branded portfolio now and the focus on it, consumers obvious desire for branded products with a point of difference, i think that positions us even better as you think about some of the levers we can pull from an inflationary environment standpoint.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. [indecipherable] and just a quick follow-up. like you said, consumers continue to focus on brands, your branded business is doing very well. you call out in the prepared remarks just the growth overall with dkb[phonetic] and canyon which is doing phenomenal. and, even relative to 2019, revenues still remain elevated. so i just think the larger question then is as consumers, they start to revert back, as you say kind of one of the three things you're keeping your eye on, right is reverse, basically channel reversion.
is there anything that you would say now relative to 12 to 18 months ago that has changed your way of thinking of maybe how to service some of the channels, like are there benefits to maybe not reverting as much, but just say, ok, we're going to leverage some excess capacity over here, a little bit private label, a little bit in the foodservice, you know what we've learned through the pandemic yes[phonetic] or no, is it just kind of get back to business as usual and that's all this time? thank you.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
yeah, thanks rob. no, i don't think it goes back necessarily business as usual. as we've said before, i do think there are -- some of these patterns are probably permanent. but, we've also consistently said we do expect to see some movement back to pre-pandemic levels. so i don't think it'll go all the way back. i do think that when school starts in august, that should give us a better kind of long-term indication of where these trends are ultimately going to land.
having said all that, no matter what that environment looks like, we believe that we're very well-positioned with our branded portfolio as i mentioned. but also as you think about food service coming back which it already did somewhat in the quarter, we started to see some moves up in food service and the good story there is via our customer strategy work it is coming back at better margins. so, as that mix reverse and food service starts to come back, it won't have as significant of an impact as it would have prior to the execution of that strategic work.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. interesting. i'll follow up on that. thank you very much.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, rob.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of bill chappell from truist, you may begin.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hi, bill.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
first a follow-up on pricing, have you seen any pricing from -- on the competitive landscape. i think we heard the other day that like little debbie in the cake side has already led[phonetic] some pricing, i imagine not all of your competitors are kind of headed the same way you are. so they may be feeling the pinch sooner than later. so didn't know if you've seen anything there or looked to follow up from that standpoint?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, nothing really significant, bill. the one comment i'd make relative to pricing just in the competitive environment is the promotional cadence and still consistent with past quarters we haven't seen really any move relative to promotions. still remain [indecipherable] sales really driving everything, though, obviously down year-over-year just given the pantry loading months. but nothing significant. i mean, we know that some of the regional players perhaps don't hedge like we do or at least not as far out. so they're a little bit more exposed to the spot market and that kind of thing. but, thus far nothing -- nothing notable at this point.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
got it.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
bill[phonetic] also it will be more of us, just like for us it could be more of a back half dynamic that of course [indecipherable].
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
yeah, sure. and then on private label, i mean, it's pretty astounding that it's gone from 26% of the category down to 20%, which is going to be one of the lowest in years. and i think i've asked this question before, but since you supply so much of the private label, i mean, at what point can you go in and push more of your branded products on the shelf and show that, hey, this is not really a great use of the space. i mean, since you do service it with dsb[phonetic], i would think that that's something that's pretty apparent to the retailers as well as the industry?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
indeed it is. yeah, you're right. we've talked about this a little bit on prior calls. but i mean, i think the retailers are seeing the benefit in our category and others, frankly of consumers preference for brands. so, we have been able to expand our shelf space but, particularly with dave's and perfectly crafted and canyon some of those leading items that we have. we will again just kind of highlighting the importance of the portfolio strategy overall. but i agree with you, it is pretty amazing to see how -- see how far balanced it is but i think that's a reflection of consumer behavior more than anything else and i'm certain that the retailers are pretty in tune[phonetic] with that.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
sure, and then last one for me, just going back a year ago, you had your 40ish bakeries being able to in a short period of time, hit a massive surge in sales. and now that we've come or we're coming back down or normalizing, i mean, do you look back and say, boy, the supply chain, the number of facilities we have could be streamlined even further, if we were really[phonetic] much more efficient than we could or more efficient and could be even more efficient by cutting out a few plants here or there, or is that not the case, is it, hey[phonetic], let's just continue to operate and grow with it?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
to the contrary. look, i mean network optimization has been one of our key areas of focus. as you know we did convert that lynchburg[phonetic] bakery, we have some other projects going on this year and are you seeing with elevated capex numbers this year. so still very much a focus point for us. as we often say, there are a lot of levers you can pull in an inflationary environment, but it's always incumbent upon us to make sure we're being as efficient as possible. so we're constantly evaluating our network from that standpoint.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
got it, but more just kind of normal process, i mean, would you i guess -- sorry, would you expect capex to be elevated going into 2022 or is this really the big year of change?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
well bill, this year the focus is on kind of the digital initiatives. we have said the digital isn't a two to three year initiative. so while we're not prepared to give guidance on 2022, i would expect you could see some elevated capex for the next two to three years, whether it's digital or whether it's working on our portfolio and optimization on some of those projects.
bill chappell -- truist -- analyst
got it. great, thanks so much.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bill.
operator
our next question comes from the line of faiza alwy from deutsche bank. you may begin.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hi faiza.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, i just wanted to follow-up on the inflation point and i don't know if you're willing to say anything on this, but i'm curious are you still hedging out into 2022 because it sounds like are you expecting sort of these prices on wheat et cetera to come down into 2022 so you rather have open positions or are you sort of continuing your programmatic hedging program at these current prices?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, we wouldn't comment specifically on 2022 at this point, but we tend to stick pretty true to our overall hedge strategy which is the seven to nine months. so, we do have some visibility into the first quarter of 2022 but the reality is it's still pretty volatile. and, beyond that, i'll probably wouldn't comment much on our particular coverage with regard to the long end of our coverage range. but, we do -- we are beginning to think about what we do for 2022.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you. and then just secondly, you talked about improving the profitability of the non-retail segment and i know you've talked about this previously, but i wonder if there's more color, are there numbers that you can put around that, just more details around how much of an impact this could have going forward or has had so far?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, well faiza, i mean, obviously, food service on a relative basis remains pretty depressed if you particularly if you compare it back to 2019. so, it's just starting to recover. the quick serve business has been the fastest to recover. i think that's actually up a bit over 2019, with the balance of the food service business still being a little bit off. we haven't quantified it before, but it's something that we measure internally. we have set new margin thresholds for our food service business and the way we're approaching it is, if we cannot get a piece of food service business to that acceptable margin threshold via price or our own efficiencies or whatever levers maybe out there for us to pull, then we have a decision to make about whether or not that's some business that we want to continue.
and so far, we've been pretty successful in getting a nice piece of that business up to those margin thresholds. having said that we're not done yet. i mean, we've still got a long way to go. we've only been executing on this for nine months or so. but early returns have been really good. and as i said, as that business has come back, it has come back at an overall higher margin level. so as we go forward, i expect it to be a meaningful contributor to the overall. we've said in the past that food service is never going to be at the margin level of branded retail, but there's certainly a lot of room for improvement. and i think, in years past our food service team and we have, i believe the best one in the industry.
there was a bit of a different strategic vision for food service that was based more on volume and sales gains than margin. but that team has now been given permission if you will to go get that margin even if it means walking away from some business from time to time. not all of it's going to fit, but there is a lot of opportunity out there in food service that we think can be nicely additive to the overall. hopefully, that helps give you a little bit more color.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. yes, definitely. thank you. and then just last one from me just on the digital initiatives. have you made any of these investments so far to adjust my reading of your comments was that you're sort of, you're not there yet, but you're still committed to the $0.05 of funding that you talked about. are those more -- should we expect those to come through more in the back half or have you already sort of started making these investments?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, we have already started. i mean, a lot of it is on the front end is working with our outside partners in the -- for the planning and design phases. but the nickel is still good for the year, that'll be a little more heavily weighted in the back half as we start executing on the plan. at which time also later this year, we will be giving you guys some more detail of where we're headed from a digital strategy standpoint.
faiza alwy -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect, thank you very much.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from line of mitchell pinheiro from sturdivant, you may begin.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
hey, good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hi mitch.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
good morning. so, couple of questions here. first, back to private label for a second, is it is a remarkable drop when you look at the trend from just several years ago, and you talked about it being sort of consumer behavior led. is any of this retailer led[phonetic]?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't think so. i think it is consumer led. if you think about the category overall mitch and just back up, let's just call it five years ago just to use a round number. yeah, there wasn't nearly as much innovation, if you will, in our category. you didn't have dkb nationwide, certainly that was basically a west coast phenomenon until we bought it. kind of the same thing with canyon, that was all in costco or in the freezer case, et cetera. and since then, i mean, we'll even talk about our competitors. i mean, certainly coming out with [indecipherable] us coming out with perfectly crafted and then obviously [indecipherable] dkb and canyon.
i think a lot of the innovation on the bread wall is driving this too. and as you know, in our category there's not much differentiation among private label items in our category. it's basically white and wheat bread. similarly, within the category, we've seen a shift from kind of your traditional lows, still a lot sold, but your 100% whole wheats or honey wheat to these specialty items, buns, breakfast in particular there's kind of been a mix shift in the category that we've been watching for some time. and obviously with our new items in both of those sub segments we've benefited. i think that's the primary driver mitch.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then looking at your, to your stack[phonetic] growth you did 3% in this quarter versus 2019 first quarter. that's looking at that over two years, obviously, it's a little above your long-term growth rate. is that -- and looking at your sort of revenue guidance for the remainder of the year, it looks like you expect to see this type of stack growth for the remainder of the year, is that accurate?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we actually feel pretty good about that, mitch. i mean, our branded retail business is actually up 13.7%. i believe it was slightly[phonetic] over 19. so we're really pleased with the overall trajectory. frankly, to me, it's even more acceptable considering the fact that private labels off as much as it is, plus we've done quite a bit of sku[phonetic] right over that period of time, too. so you've taken all that complexity out of the portfolio, really focusing on the winners. i think, we're showing that that's paying some nice dividends and we see that through the rest of the year. we're quite optimistic there.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
have you ever refined your sku rationalization drag?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, mitch, say that one more time.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
have you redefined or given us any color on what the sku rationalization drag was in percentage terms on your growth rate.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
no, i don't think so.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay. i mean how meaningful is it in the low single digits or is it or is it less than 1%. i mean is it how meaningful is sku rat to these numbers.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i will have to go back and look at that mitch, i don't have that in front of me.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay. and then as it relates on the same thing on, looking at your growth in adjusted ebitda, from 19th quarter to this current quarter, how -- is it all mixed or is there anything else in there, any cost of goods savings in there, anything else besides just a positive mix shift?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, there absolutely is. we had our $10 million to $20 million in portfolio optimization savings last year. we actually beat the top end of that. so you've got that piece of it and that's a mix of procurement savings, overhead savings, sg&a savings. so it's kind of a broad cost basket. we have a target of $30 million to $40 million out there for this year, in many of those same categories and we're on track to deliver on that as well.
and then mitch, if you think about the bakery efficiencies in some of the underperforming bakeries, making some really nice progress at navy yard, which i know you'll be happy to hear things like that. our efficiency was up in the first quarter of those. those add meaningfully to the bottom line as well.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay, terrific. and then, last question, so your market share has been creeping up in bread, over the last year or two. and is there -- have you seen anything to call out among regional differences there, i mean, are you, i don't see the regional scanner data, but is that any noteworthy changes in any regional market share gains or losses over the last year or so?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
mitch, not really. i mean, it's -- overall the share trends have been good, obviously a little bit down over the quarter last year, just given the massive gains. but sequentially up from q4 which is great to see. there's just been a lot of talk about geographic shifts and people moving out of the northeast to florida or out of california to texas, wherever it might be. we've looked at that, but there's nothing specific to call out except for one region which is the northeast. and that's the one that we've been focused on. we've been talking about that for the last few quarters, where we're kind of under-penetrated there and making some nice share gains as we focus on that important market. so that's just one that i would call out to you.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant -- analyst
okay, all right, well, thank you for your time.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks mitch.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line ryan bell from consumer edge research. you may begin.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning everyone.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hi ryan.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
if i may get a benchmark of your nonbranded business from what we can see in track channel trends and how should we think about that going forward, in general, i mean, we've been seeing private label across your categories declining. given your intentional emphasis on your branded products, we have been seeing software growth from your private label business relative to what we've seen track channels. is that something that we should expect to see for the foreseeable future?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
well i mean, i think it's yet to be seen, right. i mean, obviously, we're focusing on our brands and as i've said, i think the consumer is driving a lot of this. so there's again the shift to brand, the differentiation in brand which you don't find in private label. i think it is driving a lot of that. we are making some decisions about select pieces of our private label business, kind of the same way that we're looking at food service to the extent it's underperforming or under-delivering relative to what it should. i mean, private label is what it is. we have made some decisions to exit certain pieces of business, but yeah, i wouldn't describe that in terms of magnitude as being the primary driver. the primary driver is consumer-driven.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and then you talked about m&a being your fourth strategic priority. would you build to provide any updated thoughts about the current m&a landscape just in terms of availability of the assets and valuations overall?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. yeah, things are -- in short things are really heating up. i mean since the first of the year you have people sort of took a break largely last year. and it's -- there's a lot of books lying around out there right now. i'm sure you guys have read about some of the more public ones. but there's quite a bit of opportunity. ryan, the challenge as it has been for the past few years is valuation.
we're committed to maintaining our disciplined approach. we certainly have the balance sheet to lean in where we've got high conviction, but we're only going to do so in a reasonable way, and there's only so far we'll go and maintain our disciplined approach. so, i'm pleased to see the opportunities start to come back. certainly, we're active, we remain active. and i think it'll be -- i think overall it will be a very active year in the food space. there's just a lot of money sloshing[phonetic] around out there trying to find a place to land.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
okay. thank you. and, i think this is the last one for me, in terms of the organic growth side, you talked about some innovations in flatbread. could you maybe talk about the opportunity or how fast you'd see some of that expansion?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely. yeah, we're really pleased with the flatbreads that we introduced in the northeast, obviously continuing to innovate with dave's, the rye's out there it's doing great, right on target. great reception from consumers. if you haven't tried it, i suggest you do. it's a great loaf of rye bread. and then further out, i mean, we're standing up our agile innovation team. it's early days, we're just getting wrapped up. but the early prototypes they've shown me if some of the things that we're looking at are just outstanding. so there's a lot of great things to come, and we all know how important -- we all know how important innovation is going to be for us to continue to grow our top line in line with the long-term targets.

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] we have our first question from the line of bill chappell from truist securities. your line is now open.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hey, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey. just one of the things we've heard from several or were multiple food companies over the past month, month and a half is that there has been a meaningful for whatever reason trade-up from private label to branded. thought is, stimulus checks or other issues, though no one can quite figure it out. and clearly, that had some impact or continues to have some positive impact on your business. so i guess, the question is, do you see this is a sustainable shift or do you think that people will move back toward private label, which could put margin pressure as we move into back half of this year or into next year?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a good question, bill. in our category with private label being historically so over developed, we were actually seeing these private label declines even prior to the pandemic, and i think we've mentioned that on a couple of prior calls. we've actually done a fair bit of research, consumer insights research into why that trend was continuing and almost accelerating really. and it really comes down to, in our category, there is a distinct lack of differentiation in private label. it's basic white and wheat bread and buns, whereas in the category, and flowers has participated in this obviously, you have a lot of differentiation with the new perfectly crafted brioche rolls with things like dave's killer bread and canyon. and that's driven a bit of a premiumization process up to branded from private label.
as to whether it's sustainable or not, i actually think it is. and that's why we're making all the investments we're making behind our brands and marketing support, etc. if you get into a recessionary situation, you could see some move back to value. but even in the last recession that we saw in sort of '08, '09, we didn't see that much of a move back to private label even then.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
i guess, did you see a step change in this current quarter or is it just more of a continuation of the trend?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
it's really more a continuation of the trend. private label continues to fall and branded retail continues to hold up very, very well.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
great. and then just on the cost front, same thing, heard a lot. your peers talk about especially more on freight and incremental cost that you seem to in april, to raise eps guidance for the full year. it seems like it's less of an impact. is that largely due just to the way your supply chain distribution works or is there something else that's helping you offset these costs?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. partially that's -- and steve can jump in here too. but yeah, that's partially the dst. that work is a bit more of a closed loop system. so we're not as exposed to the long-haul freight. and then the other thing i would say is, with our hedging strategy being four to seven months out, sometimes a little bit longer, that gives us good visibility in advance of what our costs are going to be and we can be proactive about mitigating those cost.
steve, anything you'd add to that?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
no. i mean, i think as we said earlier, bill, in the year we know we had pretty good visibility into our overall cost structure for this year. obviously, the inflation in the back half is a little heavier, but we think we've taken the right steps to mitigate most of that. and as ryals said on transportation, we're not immune to the increases, but we feel like for 2021 our contracts have protected us the best they can.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks so much for the color.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bill.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of mitch pinheiro from sturdivant & company. please go ahead.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hey, mitch.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
hey. just following up on bill's question regarding private label. is the retailers' view of their private label offerings changing as well, i mean, in terms of shelf space allocation? are they looking to premiumize private label to a greater extent trying to keep private label or is that really not one of their strategies and they're willing to let the market go where it goes and/or reallocate shelf space? can you give us any -- some color on that?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we've had some isolated discussions about that, but nothing broadly in the market. we're not hearing much about wanting to premiumize private label or anything like that to this point. probably the one exception for us, the one area of private label to continues to do well is canyon's private label gluten-free. that's probably the one call out in private label that's actually showing some growth in our portfolio.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
and also as part of your discussions, are they looking to reduce shelf space to private label? i mean, clearly, the dollar value and the gross margin contribution of the brands versus private label would suggest i would think more allocation to the branded shelf space. but is that happening at all or...
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
again, i would say that it has happened to some extent, but we haven't seen any broad sort of marketwide moves to take shelf space down. but there have been some isolated customers where that's been reduced. and then you also have the labor situation that's kind of happening to everybody that limits -- somewhat limits the ability to provide all the skus. i mean, throughout this pandemic and this whole labor situation, we've had to in some cases limit some of our skus. and so that's had some effect on the shelf space allocation. but as far as the overall private label allocation, there has been no meaningful change really.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
is there -- are there any pricing changes with private label? is it a volume decline or is it -- is there pricing going up? can you talk about that a little bit?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we have taken some pricing over the last several years in private label, yes.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
in terms of -- part of your -- part of the whole strategy or some of the benefit flowers gets is from gaining share in lower penetrated newer markets, newer to flowers that is? and any bakery [phonetic] to call out geographically there are strengths or weaknesses among your territories?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, we've been calling out the northeast for the last several quarters as a focused market for us. we continue to make investments up there. and the good news is, we're seeing share gains there. we had a good quarter in the northeast. we continue to gain share on the west coast, another really strong market for us. obviously, we're super strong in the south. i mean, mitch, as you know, the big hole or opportunity for us is that whole upper midwest quadrant.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay. and then just a couple more. in terms of what's happening with snack cake and tastykake, in particular? any -- you're making progress on your profitability?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for asking. really good progress at navy yard. we're not -- we're still not where we want to be, but the trajectory is really good. the team has done a great job up there. our automation investments are paying off. scrap rates are coming down. labor in the cake markets -- in the cake plants rather continues to be a bit of a challenge. it's just the nature of the cake bakeries with more people in there. but overall, we've been able to manage through it really well. we've also done some things on the commercial side, mitch, from a price promotion standpoint, to make us more competitive there. so all signs pointing in the right direction. in fact, relative to our internal goals, we're actually ahead of plan there.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
and then, i guess, final question is, when you look longer term and you look at your margin profile, i think you mentioned that i think either in this quarter, mix is certainly a powerful help for you, you have productivity and you have your whole network optimization to support further margin improvement. but i mean, how -- it just seems that the branded versus the non-branded mix is still going to be the most important part of the change. and i'm curious as to, a, if you agree with that? and b, what you're doing? what are the specifics specifically you're doing to create the positive mix going forward?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
no, absolutely, and i agree with you. i mean, the whole notion of shifting more around mix to branded retail is the most powerful tool we have to improve our overall margin profile. but all the other things you mentioned, whether it's network optimization, whether it's our marketing investments, whether it's our digital transformation are all intended to support that mix shift to branded retail. so it all rolls up to the same strategy of over time shifting more of our mix to brands, both the brands we have today and hopefully the brands we'll have tomorrow with future in that.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay. and just -- i actually just had one more sort of a question speaking of m&a is, can you talk, a, about your pipeline or maybe the environment in m&a right now?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. really no change from last quarter. i mean, it's -- deal activity continues to pick up. we're looking at quite a few things right now, which is a welcome change from last year when it really kind of dried up. so we're happy with the pipeline. and mitch, it's nice to be in the position that we are in, that we've got the balance sheet to act when the timing is right.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay. thank you. i'll get back in the queue.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mitch.

thank you. our next question is from ryan bell with consumer edge research. please go ahead.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
hi. how are you guys?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, ryan.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning. so just touching maybe a little bit more on the inflationary environment and the impacts of the rising costs. can you talk about maybe your ability to take pricing as we get into the end of the year in 2022?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
yeah. i mean, obviously, we're not going to talk about 2022 today. we're not prepared at this point to give guidance. although it is on our mind given the inflationary environment we're in, we've seen pretty substantial runs like most other companies. regardless of which industry or segment you're operating in, we're all experiencing pretty tremendous inflation. what i would say for 2021, and i think we talked about in our prepared comments, in the back half, we're pretty confident in our overall cost structure and also confident in the measures we've taken to mitigate the inflation the way we have whether that was pricing, i think you'll see promotional efficiency, which we saw in q2. a lot of our projects are on track with regard to efficiencies and kinds of productivity. and we expect really to use kind of the same tools going into 2022. but beyond that, no, i can't really comment about beyond this year.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hey, ryan. one thing that i would add to it and we mentioned this a bit in our prepared remarks, is if you think back to the last inflationary period, significant inflationary period that we saw sort of the '07, '08 period, we were a much different company back then. our market share was a lot lower. we really only had one sort of quasi national brand in nature's own. and then you fast forward to today, and we've got -- roughly in '18 share. we've got nature's own and expanded nature's own now with perfectly crafted as well, we've got dave's, we've got canyon, we've got wonder. and so the brand portfolio, if you will, is quite a bit stronger than it was, which also gives us greater confidence that we can pull that lever to the extent necessary to help mitigate any rises in cost.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's helpful. and then could you talk about how you're thinking of the back-to-school season in terms of your guidance? what you're assuming about the season? and sort of what would change potentially to your base case given some of the variability that we would see with the delta variant and the back-to-school and other types of getting back to normal?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. our perspective on that is changed markedly since the first of the year when we first issued guidance. and then with the vaccine rollout, we were kind of planning for what that was going to look like and how that was going to affect the market dynamics. and now here we find ourselves right at the beginning of back-to-school season, we've got this delta variant that's surging significantly across the country.
so our perspective has changed as the dynamics out there have changed. and obviously, it's hard to say. we had originally expected that the back-to-school season will give us a really good indication of what the new normal might look like in a more steady state going forward. i think the rise of the delta variant has brought that somewhat in the question and may push that timeline out a bit now. and obviously, in our results through q2 and even the beginning of q3, we're continuing to see very strong branded retail performance in line with what we've been seeing for the first part of the year.
so yeah, it's going to be a little bit of a wait and see. i would have thought that back-to-school would have -- and people starting to return to office would have given us a better indication, but i think that's gotten pushed out a little bit now.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and would you be able to provide maybe a little bit more detail about some of the shifts in your capex guidance this year? i know you took it down a little bit and you said that it was largely due to delays from the pandemic. is the expectation for that just to shift out to next year?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
yeah. i mean, the majority of that will just roll into 2022. i mean, the reality is there is no one i would say one specific or large project that was impacted. it's kind of across the whole. just some delay in timing and getting equipment in for some of the projects.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. and then just the last one for me. how would you feel just about the general longer term impacts as incremental at-home demand -- i mean, i think that it's pretty evident at this point that there is going to be incremental work from home relative to 2019. so could you potentially share some of your thoughts about the extent of the potential for this to impact your business over the next few years?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'd be happy to. frankly, ryan, i'm quite optimistic about it. i mean, i think there has been a fundamental shift in several things, some good and some not so good. the good parts are i think that the future of work is going be a lot different. we here at flowers are going to be doing it differently permanently. and many other companies, as you read, are doing the same thing. and i think that shift or that change in mindset really only benefits our business with more people eating at home, more sandwiches consume, whatever it might be, i think we're very well positioned. coupled with that our commitment to innovation and continuing to bring new and exciting offerings to the consumer, that's going to continue to be really important for us to drive future growth. so i'm frankly really optimistic.
on the negative side, the labor situation continues to be difficult. as we read across every industry, whether service manufacturing or otherwise, it's a difficult situation. it's tough to attract and retain people right now. so far we've done a really good job of managing through it. it has not been easy, but we've been able to continue to serve the market effectively throughout this period. but it is a challenge and we're having to relook at how we view labor in the bakeries, and we'll probably have to make both some short-term and long-term changes to how we approach that, because i think it's more than just extended unemployment benefits. i think there has been a systemic change of how work is viewed in this country.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of ben bienvenu with stephens. your line is now open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
hey, ben.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
ryals, i want to follow-up on that -- on the compensation side of things. you talked about you're reviewing compensation, i'm wondering where you are today in that process? what's considered in your guidance with respect to compensation and benefits for the balance of the year in fiscal '21? and then you talked about a combination of short and long-term, it sounds like you're being holistic with how you approach this and more surgical. can you talk about your mindset and kind of what you're seeing today relative to normal? and how you feel about your ability to kind of ameliorate those dynamics?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, for '21, i wouldn't worry about it too much from a wage standpoint, because the one thing i think it's more than just wages that are the issue. now certainly we'll look at that, we do periodically look at that any way to make sure that each of our markets our bakeries are competitive. but the -- again, the whole dynamics change. what you used to look at as your peer set in manufacturing has changed and we used to look at other food companies or warehouses. well, now you're competing against amazon, you're competing against tesla. and with all the government payments coming in, you're competing with the government too. so it makes it pretty difficult.
so you're right, we're taking a holistic look because i don't believe it's only about compensation, it could be to some extent, and we want to remain competitive. but i think the quality of life factors are even more important. and what i mean by that is, bakeries can be hot, they can be unpleasant in the summer time, what can we do to improve the overall working environment inside the bakeries. we're looking at different of uniforms, we're looking at different cooling systems, etc., those types of things. but one of the biggest issues for us, and i've mentioned this before, is scheduling in the bakeries.
working in a bakery is a tough job. and we're running the bakeries really hard, particularly right now with the labor shortage. and we've had increases in overtime and things, because of that our folks are working really hard, and that's not a situation that you want to sustain for too long. so what can we do from a scheduling standpoint to give more consecutive days off, more predictive or predictable rather schedule so that people can plan their child care or doctor visits or whatever it might be in daily life that they need to do. so we're looking at a myriad number of things to help mitigate this. and i'm glad that we are because i don't think that this is a temporary situation.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
yeah, ok. it makes sense. and then you noted promotional efficiency contributed to better price mix. can you talk about what's happening there? is it that this kind of return to normal or new normal dynamic around consumer behavior is sustaining volumes better than you thought? is it initiatives that you have in place? maybe just help us understand what's going on there and kind of the glide path associated with that? how repeatable is that dynamic?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i'll let -- i'll start and steve can chip in if he has something else. but yeah, the overall promotional environment has been pretty steady for a while now. and it's really in our category, i would call it, at least five year lows, and that's been pretty steady. and with the demand for branded retail price, i don't see that changing anytime soon. we also internally do a much better job with our tpm system than we did historically at managing our promotions and only pursuing those that have a high return associated with them. and so both the kind of the macro environment is supporting this, but also our internal efforts are being more efficient with our promotions is helping.
steve, anything you'd add?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
no. i mean, i think ryals' point about systems really can be emphasized enough. i mean, in the last couple of years we've worked really hard on implementing some new technology, and it gives us great visibility. and like we talked about in q1, promotional activity has pulled back quite a bit. so it's really about that getting priced. a lot of our inflation comes in the back half. so that's where the more true pricing would show up i would say. so we've been really pleased kind of with the promotional environment and the levels we've seen, and that's been a big part of the margin equation.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and ben, the only thing i would add to it is, we did implement a price increase right at the beginning of q3. and while it's early days, we've been really pleased with how volume has held up with that price increase. so that's encouraging certainly.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
yeah, for sure. okay, very good. thanks so much, and best of luck.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of bill chappell with truist.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
three, guys, kind of quick questions. one, based on kind of your commentary in the prepared remarks. one, you talk about you're not really -- it's too early to tell what kind of normal looks like in terms of people reverting back to work and to school and the stuff like that, kind of post delta variant, but you're pretty well exposed in states like texas and florida where they kind of move back to normal a little bit faster than the rest of the country. so maybe tell us what you're seeing there and kind of what that tells you for as we look to '22 in terms of kind of consumption?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, bill, it's really kind of broad-based across the country. we've been really pleased with how well things have held up particularly on the branded retail side. so nothing really in particular call -- to call out by region except to say overall the brand investments that we continue to make, the innovation we continue to introduce has really helped us hold on to a lot of these -- lot of these consumers. and similarly, we're also seeing further increases in household penetration, velocities are up, repeat buyers are up. so all the signs point in a pretty optimistic direction when you think about what returns to normal ultimately looks like.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then in terms of costs, the comment of you may look to do additional pricing to cover the costs and can you remind us, do you -- are you looking to kind of cover margin or cover profit dollars in terms of gross margin looking forward?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, obviously the ultimate goal will be to protect both now. at the end of the day, the consumer is going to, going to drive the ultimate results, right? consumers are experiencing very, very broad-based inflation. we've all read the headlines, 30-year highs, fifth straight month over 5% and that kind of thing. so everything from gasoline to our products is going up. so we'll have to -- have to wait and see how the consumer at the end of the day reacts to that. if we find ourselves in a situation where there is a trade down the value or units drop off, you could -- it's certainly reasonable to assume that there could be some margin compression in the short-term. but what i'd say overall about the inflationary environment is whether you believe it's transitory or whether you think it'll last a little bit longer than that, ultimately these issues are temporary and not completely within our control. so we're focused on what we can control. we will continue to make investments in our brands. we'll continue to make investments in our digital capabilities, etc., that over time will lead to expanded margins.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then lastly for me, you've made the comment in the remarks of, like you're seeing m&a activity pick up. and i guess the question is, why is that the case? i mean, i was under the impression the same kind of key targets you've been talking to for years, if not decades, and so i didn't know why things would start picking up now or -- and maybe some more color around that comment?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i mean, i think maybe a little bit earlier in the year it may have been driven by some tax issues, now will ultimately see where that -- where that bill fall. it looks like some of that's going to knock [indecipherable] so that could have been driving some of it. and you're right, we still continue to talk to some of the same targets that we have for a number of years, but the activity has really picked up, bill, more in the adjacent product categories, some more in the snacking space that kind of thing.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks so much for the color.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, bill.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ben bienvenu with stephens.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, everybody. so i want to ask about just this continued strength in branded retail, really good results still. i'm sure the mix is still supporting gross margins even in an environment where you're seeing some cost increases. i'm curious if you could talk about, do you think we're at this equilibrium now? do you think this is an equilibrium that we can grow off of? and to what degree as we continue to see maybe pricing increases, does that influence the shift from branded retail, the store branded retail products?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, great, great question. i think, i think that's a key point. and as always, i was mentioning in response to bill a minute ago. i mean, it's all going to be about the consumer and so far even with the pricing actions that we took in july, branded retail units have held up very, very well. i mean, we've seen little to no drop off at all in branded units. now going forward, as you look into next year with all the inflation in consumer space with stimulus payments coming off that kind of thing, i think it's yet to be seen just how much the consumer is willing to absorb and will be -- that will be a key topic for next year, right? yeah, we've been through situations like this before most recently and 7/09 [phonetic] time period. this has held up relatively well. we do offer products across a variety of price points, which certainly helps from the super premium dave's killer bread all the way down to private label with some -- with some with some pricing in between too on nature's own and wonder that kind of thing. so we feel like we're very, very well positioned to do well in any environment. obviously, we would be most pleased if the current trends that we're -- that we're watching continues, but i think it's really all about the inflationary impact on the consumer and what they'll be able to absorb. but that also makes it more important than ever that we continue to keep up with our [technical issues] pressing forward on innovation and we keep developing our capabilities such that eventually this will subside. it always does. and when it does, we'll be positioned even stronger.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
yeah, perfect, understood. and on the cost side of the equation, how much visibility do you have into the balance of this year, into early next year? and any thoughts that you have on what that looks like and kind of where we are in terms of the curve of cost inflation and how close do you think we are to maybe seeing a light at the end of the tunnel from your vantage point?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
sure, obviously, given where we are in the year and the fact we do no forward buy and adds a lot of our commodity spend, we have full visibility for 2021. so from that perspective, we've been talking about the cadence of inflation for this year. a majority of it is coming in, in the fourth quarter. so, we'll begin to see some of that ramp up and all that is priced into the guidance we gave yesterday when we released. looking forward 2022, we're not prepared to give guidance today, but obviously you can look out the forward curve is pretty significant inflation and if things stay in the market levels we see today as we said in our -- in our prepared remarks, we expect to see pretty meaningful inflation next year. but as ryals commented, we're looking at efforts to mitigate that through pricing as well as other cost initiatives, so we anticipate this to be at least another one year cycle and as ryals just said whether it's truly transitory or not, make -- it could go slightly beyond a year, but right now all indications are that the inflation will hold through most of 2022 and well and hit the cost side.
ben bienvenu -- stephens -- analyst
okay, sounds good. thanks so much for the thoughts and best of luck with the rest of the year.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ben.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve powers with deutsche bank.
stephen powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah, hey, thanks. and i guess picking up on what we've already been talking about your prepared -- your prepared remarks and then some of the conversation, just wanted -- just really underscore the uncertainties around, around the pacing of demand migration back toward pre-pandemic levels potentially and just inflation headwinds and other other variables, plus we know that you've got ongoing strategic investments around technology and branding otherwise. so i guess, just in that context i'm hoping you could elaborate on the drivers that, yeah, as i read your presentation, at least the presentation slides and accompanying prepared remarks talk about the confidence and expectation to get on to those long-term, that long-term algorithm in fiscal '22. so maybe -- unless that with a misread on my part, just what are the drivers that despite all uncertainties you feel like you've got confidence of visibility to lock-in those long-term growth targets next year?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
well, sure. i mean, i think we've already alluded to a few and that -- just to reiterate. one, the momentum that we carry into '22. i mean, we have gained a lot of consumers over the past two years. we've invested a lot behind our brands. we're clearly growing our share nationally, but also in very important markets like the northeast where we're under-penetrated. we have a lot of new innovation items, some of which we're testing right now, some of which will be forthcoming next year. we're quite excited about to continue to drive topline growth. i mean, you're right. we are making significant investments in our erp platform and other digital capabilities that over the long haul and will enable us to stay on that long-term, long-term algorithm. and then of course, steve, we also have taken a look at the balance sheet. we're obviously poised for acquisition activity should the right opportunity come along. so all those things put together give us confidence that we can -- that we can stay on our long-term algorithm using 2019 as the best year.
stephen powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, ok, great. and i guess, maybe just sort of slightly different topic, just on your -- on your manufacturing footprint. obviously, a diverse footprint of bakeries and i'm assuming that gives you a pretty good amount of flexibility to help navigate different supply chain challenges, but, so maybe you can elaborate that on, just kind of talk about that generally, but i'm also hoping just for some visibility into how variable operating conditions are across your bakery footprint? are things relatively similar across the board or are there -- is there a lot of -- are there other kind of flash points where you're having more, more challenges? i'm kind of thinking particularly from a labor perspective. but any color you have there would be great. thanks.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, not so much by region of the country. i mean, the labor challenges are pretty consistent, pretty consistent across the company and we do have a few areas where we've had somewhat less issues than other areas. but generally speaking, it's pretty consistent across the country. now, we have been able to manage through that, i think pretty well just given the challenges that we're -- that we're all facing, but it's still a challenge, and it does -- it does impact our efficiency. you've got -- you read the short hand or do you have a lot of new people on bakery, for example, that increases your scrap, lowers your efficiency that kind of thing. the one call i would -- the one call i would make, it has been a bit more intense in the cake bakeries, but those are more labor intensive operations to begin with, you just -- you have more people, particularly in packaging there. so still a little bit more acute there, but not the same token. we've been able to manage through it pretty well.
stephen powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, that's great color. thank you very much.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mitch pinheiro with sturdivant and company.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
good morning.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, mitch.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
so you have you defined what you're inflation rate has been on cost of goods for 2021?
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
we have not given that specific measure. i mean, because of the way we hedge, we don't want, obviously coming into 2021 is really what you begin to see the inflation ramp, so it was more back half-driven, but we haven't given a specific percentage, just maybe for competitive reasons.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay, and then...
r. steve kinsey -- chief financial officer and chief accounting officer
you can do -- you can do the math with the input cost, it would be pretty much in line, but beyond that we haven't disclosed it.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay. when you -- with the branded growth surging, i'd love to hear more about your brand building efforts, i mean, in particular is -- obviously, some of this is driven by the consumer looking for -- the branded growth looking, looking for premium products, looking for higher quality and more diverse set of baked goods. but i was wondering whether you're looking to capitalize and market your way with gross more so that in the past and i love to hear what you're doing and how you're spending is allocated? is it being shifted more to td [phonetic] like i've seen in the dave's killer bread or is it a digital e-commerce initiative, it look you're a little more on that?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure, mitch, happy to. and you can just take a look at our marketing spend and see over the last several years how much we granted out to support the portfolio strategy, growing our branded business at a faster rate. you touched on a lot of them already. i mean, a lot of it is being allocated toward -- toward our aggressive growth brands, will that canyon, nature's own, dkb, it's been more intense in parts of the country where we're under penetrated, like in northeast, that's why you're seeing some of the commercials up your way. and you're also correct on digital. e-commerce is about 8% of our sales right now, which is roughly in line with the category we want to continue to grow that. i think e-commerce is going to continue to be a bigger and bigger part of the picture and we need to have that, that digital presence.
but on the other side, we're also investing in consumer insights. we have to -- we have to understand our consumers such that we can continue to deliver the innovation that they want in the category. so some of that spend is going into -- into that and continued investments in r&d. and i think you'll -- you'll start to see some of that as we go forward with some of the newer innovation items that we're coming out with that are -- that are not in the bread category, put it that way.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
in that when comes to dave's killer bread, what's driving the growth there. obviously, you have new products. i was -- would be curious to hear a bit more about either any particular channels you'd like to call out products and their distribution gains happening. i'd love to understand more what's driving dkb rather, more than just -- there's just strong demand for organic product.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i think, at the end of the day. first of all, it all starts with quality. there are other organics that are out there, but dave has a commanding 70 [phonetic] share per region of this. it's the best tasting, the best quality, best consistency. we're continuing to grow in the northeast, mitch, which is a big part of the puzzle there, bringing on lynchburg last year to support that growth has been a huge thing for us in dave's evolution. we continue to come out with new products with dave's. we're testing some new products right now with them. there'll be more coming next year. so increasing awareness is a big one. i've talked about this before. when you look at the great success of dave's that we're all very proud of, of course. but then you compare with household penetration to that of nature's own, it's roughly half that of nature's own. so even with the great growth we've experienced, we feel like that brand still has a ton of runway ahead of it, both within it's current categories and in other categories. so because i think the brand is strong enough now to begin playing across different categories, which we're obviously very excited about.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
and then just final question with any update on your cake business as far as the manufacturing side. are we -- is a lot of that solved or is it still work in progress in 2022?
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, mitch, not solved yet, but great progress this year. we're ahead of pace actually, which we're very pleased about. but as i said on the past several calls, though we are pleased with the progress, we still have some ways to go, but the improvement this year has been material.
mitchell pinheiro -- sturdivant & co. -- analyst
okay. okay, thank you very much.
a. ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, mitch.

operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the flowers foods fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand conference over to your speaker today, mr.
j.t. rieck, senior vice president of finance and investor relations. the floor is yours.
j. t. rieck -- senior vice president of finance and investor relations
thank you, and good morning. i hope everyone had the opportunity to review our earnings release and listen to our prepared remarks and view the slide presentation that were all posted yesterday evening on our investor relations website. after today's q&a session, we will also post an audio replay of this call. please note that in this q&a session, we may make forward-looking statements about the company's performance.
although we believe these statements to be reasonable, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. in addition to what you hear in these remarks, important factors relating to flowers foods business are fully detailed in our sec filings. we also provide non-gaap financial measures for which disclosure and reconciliations are provided in the earnings release and at the end of the slide presentation on our website. joining me today are ryals mcmullian, president and ceo; and steve kinsey, our cfo.
operator, we're ready to start the q&a, please.  
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from ben bienvenu of stephens. your line is open.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. this is jim salera on for ben. i wanted to ask a little bit about inflation moving into the new year. i guess, first of all, on the january 2022 price increase, how long do you think that will take to get fully implemented? and then maybe you can talk a little bit about the cadence expectations for inflation in the year.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks for the question. well, the january price increases is in large measure. there's a few small pieces of it that's just due to contracts rotating over.
but the lion's share of the pricing -- january price increases is already in for the year.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then can you guys talk maybe a little bit about expectations kind of as the year progresses for inflation?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean, when you look at the overall inflationary environment, obviously, we were building in q4. so in 2022 -- i mean, yes, 2022, as we said, we expect it to ramp throughout the year and then, obviously, q4 comps. while we still don't have inflation, we'll pull back slightly.
so you should see a ramp and then q2, q3 would probably be the highest cost, and then it pulls back slightly in q4.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. and if i could sneak in one more question. in regards to freight, do you guys have a hedging position on freight cost? or do you have any visibility into what freight costs might do into 2022?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
two things on freight. one, if you recall, our biggest transportation cost is around our dsd network. so we termed out a closed-loop network. we actually have three primary haulers who take product from the bakeries to the warehouses.
so those contracts are usually known a couple of years in advance. but we are seeing elevated costs for those as well. and then from a kind of open market transaction on our warehouse business, we have to go to the market from time to time for product delivery there, but we do not hedge any of that. so we try to buy it forward as much as we can.
but the reality is, like most companies, we'll be in the kind of the current market on the 3pl situation.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
ok. thanks, guys. i'll pass it on. thank you. 
operator
and next, we have bill chappell of truist securities. your line is open.
donald innocent-ike -- truist securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. this is donald on for bill. i just want to ask a question on any color you could provide on your foodservice business versus 2019 levels? and also with regards to current inflation, on the cost front, how much of that would you attribute toward labor? and do you believe there is a time where that could plateau at some point? thank you.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. the foodservice business, as you saw, did recover some in the fourth quarter, and we saw that sort of through the second half of the year last year. it's still below 2019 levels, but there has been some recovery there. as you know, we've been doing a lot of work on our foodservice business to improve the profitability of it as it does come back because, obviously, we've been expecting at least some amount of reversion as we hopefully start to exit this pandemic situation.
but it does still remain below 2019 levels. and conversely, our branded retail business continues to hold up really, really well given the continued at-home eating trends, our investments in our premium brands, etc., have all helped that business to maintain its place as part of the mix. do you want to address the question? 
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yes. when you look at, i think, your question around labor inflation, i mean, we're really no different than other companies. i mean the labor market is really tight, as you know. so we're expecting kind of mid to below to mid-single-digit labor inflation throughout the year, depending on which market you're in.
donald innocent-ike -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thank you very much. 
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
thank you. 
operator
thank you. up next, we have rob dickerson of jefferies. your line is open.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks so much. just a couple of questions. i guess, first one, i missed the, like, first minute of the call, so sorry if you already spoke to this.
just in terms of the -- i guess, the gross margin and eps potential cadence for the year. i know in the prepared remarks, you're just kind of speaking to kind of first half, back half-ish with some moving pieces, obviously, in the back half. but kind of given what we saw in q4, should the market kind of be expecting, let's say, similar year-over-year gross margin that kind of plays out in q1 despite the higher pricing? and then just kind of in earnings, are we kind of implied kind of flattish in q1? just whatever you're willing to disclose would be great.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yes. sure, rob. i mean, obviously, we don't give guidance on gross margin, specifically, and definitely not by quarter. but i'd say, overall, we are expecting some pressure on the gross margin line.
so it should be down on a year-over-year basis, so when we get to the full year. from a cadence perspective, obviously, our inflationary costs will build throughout the year. and then because of the experience in q4, we'll see some of that pull back, if you will. and then ryals talked briefly about pricing.
you may not have heard the comments, but we do have our january price increases pretty much in. and then we anticipate, in certain categories or certain distribution segments, more pricing coming. so that will build through the first half as well. and then depending on the inflationary -- what really happens with the inflationary environment, because -- while we do have hedges on and we said we're about 70% covered for the year, obviously, we still have some open coverage in the back half.
so there could be potential that things don't moderate somewhat. we would need to look again at some pricing initiatives as well. but we expect kind of just like we said in the release, the cadence thing will build. a lot of our savings initiatives start to come in q3.
so we do anticipate a build from that perspective and with regard to overall margin for the year. 
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. perfect. that was helpful. and then kind of simplistically, again, probably for you, steve, and then i have one for ryals.
just on the top-line guide for the year, i'm assuming kind of what we're seeing is maybe all of that's driven by pricing, maybe volumes, you've kind of implied or maybe down low single digit. i'm just kind of basing this off of kind of the level of pricing still in q4, but then also kind of what we already see in the january data set on the track side. so just kind of any kind of perspective on kind of that rate of pricing as of now, excluding any additional pricing? it sounds like you're kind of talking high single-digit-ish. is that fair?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yes. when you look at the tracked channel data, i mean, we're still seeing some positive mix. so that's also helping drive. but obviously, as in q4, pricing is a big driver of that.
so i would expect you would see that throughout most of the year.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. fair enough.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
the savings you're speaking to, kind of, so far, and then through '22, doesn't seem like it's really contingent on bakery of the future. but obviously, bakery of the future would provide, i would think, some material savings in the out year. so is that something that kind of starts to kind of go into your network this year and that's kind of more of a '23 and forward optimization, upside potential piece? just anything you have there?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, exactly. i mean, we do start -- we do expect to start to see benefits from bakery of the future this year. and as you saw in the prepared remarks, we'll have it rolled out to half of the bakeries this year on the back of the three or four pilots that we've done over the last several months.
so we do expect the cadence of savings to begin this year, but we also expect, as you indicate, that that will ramp up in '23 and '24.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. cool. thank you. i'll pass it on. 
thanks, rob.
operator
thank you. next, we have mitch pinheiro of sturdivant & company. your line is open.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
hey, good morning. hey, just a follow-up there on bakery of the future. so number one, how disruptive is it to change over a bakery into -- from current to the bakery of the future mode? is it -- like what are we talking? what's happening? is it just you're moving some servers around and you have more computer screens out there? or are you shutting down lines and things like that? can you talk about that a little bit?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so from an operational standpoint, it's not disruptive. so we're not having to shut things down. it's mostly -- this is mostly data-driven type stuff at this point.
i mean, obviously, we're doing some automation work, robotics and that type of thing, which is a little bit of a different story. as you know, we did that in navy yard. but the pure initial for us to bakery of the future is mostly around data, better data, more real-time data, driving out inefficiencies, lowering scrap costs, etc. so from an operational standpoint, mitch, it's not disruptive, hardly at all.
the way that it is somewhat disruptive is it does require us to change the mindset of the bakeries. and that does take a little bit of time. these folks are -- have operated a certain way for a very long time, and you bring in all this fancy digital equipment and try to sell them on the prospects for improvement that it can provide. and that takes a little bit of time to educate them on how it can benefit them, make their daily lives easier and improve the performance of the bakery.
so it's really -- it's as much of a change management exercise as it is anything else. but so far, we've been very pleased with the receptivity of the bakeries.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
and then a lot of that is -- so how does that dovetail with the new erp program? i mean, i haven't been shopping for an erp program personally, but i was sort of stunned to see $275 million of cost for five -- over five years. like where -- like where is that being spent? is that just all software costs with a little bit of hardware? i mean what -- that's a big number, or maybe, is it not a big number?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean when you look at these big projects and you can look kind of across the -- kind of our peer set as well, i mean, these are not cheap projects, if you will. as we said in the release, about 40%, 50% of the costs will be capitalized. and the rest will be the cost of primarily implementing and rolling out the project itself.
but when you look at the erp itself, a lot of that is technology-driven and will be kind of a foundation or an enabler for bakery of the future. the majority of the cost runs through erp are not necessarily through kind of the digital work around bakery of the future. but yes -- but to your point, the -- it's not an insignificant cash flow item. and a large part of the erp costs, from a capital standpoint, will come this year.
so you should -- you'll begin to see that tail off some over the next four years or so. 
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then -- when you go back and just look at some of the balance sheet numbers, like if you look at your fixed asset turns and things like that, it'd been kind of stuck. and i was sort of expecting as we sort of roll through bakery of the future and as you like sort of adjust your capacity and things like that, are we going to see -- i mean, are we going to see better fixed asset turns going forward? i mean, i realize that baking is a regional business when it comes to manufacturing. you need to be near your markets.
but are we going to see some leverage here where you can go several years without adding capacity because you're finding it through your efficiencies? or is what your fixed asset turns, is it going to be sort of set for a while? we're really not going to see much improvement there. can you talk a little bit about that, please?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
well, a couple of things there, mitch. one, obviously, our aim is to significantly improve the efficiency of the bakery. so that, in and of itself, will help us create some capacity. but also remember, we are doing some work via our customer strategy to -- over time, as we shift more of the mix to branded retail, to convert some of that lower-margin business into our branded business.
and you've seen examples of that in tuscaloosa and lynchburg with the organic conversions, and we'll continue to do that. but those customer strategies also open up opportunities for us to further optimize the network. you point out that, in a fresh business, we do need to be relatively close to the market, but we don't have to be as close as we used to be. with some of the inside technology that's out there now that we're already utilizing, that old 250-mile radius is not as relevant as it once was.
so that opens up additional opportunities for us as well. 
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
moving on. as far as foodservice, what type of initiatives are you taking to improve profitability there? can you give us some examples?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. i mean, look, price is the most obvious one. and we've said many times that we do have some accounts that are underperforming. so we continue to work on those.
some of those are under contracts, so they do take some time. but price is certainly one lever. our own efficiencies are another. this is not all about the customer.
it's incumbent upon us to be as efficient as possible. so those are two things. but also method of delivery, too. because some of these accounts are still dsd, which is a pretty expensive route to market, as you know.
and converting them to a more optimized distribution model can help as well. so those are just a few of the levers we're pulling.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then a final question on m&a. your balance sheet is in terrific shape. you have some great low-cost fixed debt now.
you have ample room on your revolvers. you'll still generate plenty ample free cash flow next year based on my estimates. so i know that you're going to stay disciplined. you're going to find the right thing, but i mean, how close are we? should we expect to see some m&a this coming year? and i know you can't predict timing, but are we -- i mean, is it still like -- what is really on the radar right now? or is there things that are working that we shouldn't be surprised to see something in 2022?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes, mitch. i mean, we've been saying for some time now, our appetite rather for m&a is certainly high. it's been a while since we've done one. we have a good pipeline of opportunities that we continue to look at.
just for one reason or another, we haven't pulled the trigger on one because of fit or price or a combination of the two. but we continue to be active in the space. and i don't -- i can't predict what's going to happen this year. and i wouldn't want to sort of prognosticate there, but just know that we're -- we continue to be active in that market.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
all right. thank you for -- thanks for your time.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, mitch.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question comes from ryan bell of consumer edge research. your line is open.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning. i just had a quick question about the erp upgrade and sort of the efficiencies that would be provided by it. is there sort of any savings number that you could talk to? we saw something on the cost side. just to kind of understand exactly what you get out of that program.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yes, ryan. i think a couple of things on the erp upgrade. one, sap is our enterprisewide erp system. the reality is, one would say we're forced, but we had to make a move because sap has been to their s/4hana platform across the whole.
so at some point, service for our ecc platform will drop off. so that's driving a portion of the move in the cost. secondly, because we have to make that move and because of the digital initiatives, they were looking at things that will enable productivity needs or hopefully drive long-term efficiencies across the bakeries. so there will be efficiency gains that have come out of this initiative, but we're not disclosing those at this point.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
ok. and then just a broader question about the evolution of your portfolio as we're seeing a bit more normalization of the environment. obviously, the branded part of your business has been doing really well. and just trying to understand, how do you think about the shift in the migration toward branded? how much of that can continue? and then in terms of the private label trends, why do you think that they're actually so soft despite some of the pricing that's coming through from the industry standpoint?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. yes. this is ryals. so on the private label side, i mean, we're really seeing the continuation of a trend that's been going on for over five years now.
and it certainly seemed to accelerate during the pandemic. but even as we kind of get toward the end of that, we're seeing similar trends. i mean, it was down rather significantly again in the fourth quarter. we're seeing it down in units.
it's up a little bit in dollars so far this year. but in terms of units, it's down even as we start this year. . and what we would point to through our research is you're seeing a premiumization trend in the category, where people are really gravitating toward more differentiated items. and obviously, we benefited significantly from that with the branded portfolio that we have today, particularly when you think about the dave's killer bread and canyon.
and then on the nature's own side, particularly the perfectly crafted subline for nature's own have done extremely well. canyon and dave's were both up double digits in the fourth quarter. we're seeing that trend continue even after the -- those are already premium items. and after the price increase in january, we're seeing that trend continue.
so it really demonstrates the consumers' preference for a premium quality differentiated item. and typically, with private label in our category, you don't see a lot of that. and so that's kind of -- that's the primary driver. and then as we think about the prospects for our brands going forward, with the innovation we're bringing to market, we mentioned the dkb snack bars that we're really excited about.
and early returns on those have been fantastic, really shows you that these strong brands can play across categories, which obviously gives us opportunity outside of our core space, if you will.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
ryan, this is steve. just one quick follow-up on your benefit question around erp plus. when we started this project, the discussion there was, and ryals have said it many times as well, part of this initiative really is going to be an enabler to drive productivity that helps us hit the long-term targets we have out there. so we really expect, in those target ranges, to see the benefit from the digital and erp initiative.
and that, hopefully, will drive us somewhere to the upper end of our range. but that's the -- that's really how we're looking at it more internally.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
and then just one last one for me in terms of what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint. i know you're talking about the premiumization trend across the category. just -- is there a sense as to how much of the pricing is actually being driven by mix shift and stronger demand for products like canyon's and dave's versus sort of pricing on an individual product basis?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
i mean, with the pricing we took, and i think ryals talked about it briefly with the current iri data for period one, we're seeing it really across the whole branded portfolio. obviously, your premium products are going to drive more -- any increases. but so far, we've taken pricing across, i would say, the whole, not specifically one brand.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. that's it for me. 
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
thank you. 
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we have a follow-up from robert dickerson of jefferies. your line is open.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. just a clarification question, steve, on cash flow in q4. it was a little light. i'm assuming there were probably some working cap headwinds on the inventory side.
so maybe just explain if that's right. and then the only other question i have was just on the purchase of the lease portfolio. i've rarely seen that line item pop up. i'm not sure if that's part of the bakery of the future optimization plans.
maybe just those two quick questions.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, when you look at kind of the fourth quarter on the lease portfolio, there was an opportunity that came to us kind of mid-quarter with regard to that. it was a collection of several warehouses and it fits in with our warehouse optimization strategy. so it did give us the ability to take out some leases and now we have some flexibility to look at how we're going to utilize these warehouses or potentially combine some warehouses.
so that does fit in with that long-term strategy. and then the remainder of the elevated capex in q4 was primarily driven around some of the project work, if you will, the transformation in erp you've alluded to in the kind of working capital.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. all right. cool. thank you. 
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
thank you.

ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, j.t. good morning, everybody. i appreciate you joining our first quarter call. i'm very proud of our team's performance in a tough environment.
their perseverance drove record quarterly results in sales and adjusted eps. our leading brands continue to gain share and we're successfully implementing strategies to further that growth. inflations and supply chain disruptions are impacting virtually all companies, and we're not immune from that. our team is working diligently to offset those pressures.
and we do call out a $0.05 impact to our '22 results, but we expect those headwinds to be resolved in the third quarter. the fundamentals of the business are strong, and i've never been more optimistic about our prospects. and no matter the environment, our team is focused on delivering results in line with or better than our long-term financial targets. so with that, shannon, we're ready to start the q&a, please.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from ryan bell with consumer edge research. your line is open.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
when we're looking at the price/mix that you have, would you be able to potentially do any -- some of what's coming from pricing, what's coming from mix? and then as you're thinking about consumer elasticities, they seem to have held up pretty well. the next wave of pricing across the market are hitting a bit more of a pressured consumer. so if you'd be able to offer any perspective on that, that would be great. thanks.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks for the question, ryan. i'll take the elasticities part and then turn it over to steve for price/mix. so so far this year, we've been really encouraged by what we've seen.
our elasticities have been lower than even we anticipated. i think we called out in the prepared remarks that most encouraging is the fact that with a significant amount of price increases in january, we actually grew our units as well with our top brands, nature's own, dave's, and canyon. so i see that as a really good sign going forward. now as we said, we were implementing another price increase in june, and so there's a bit of a wait and see there to see how the consumer reacts to that second round of pricing.
we all know that the consumer is under quite a bit of pressure, though, i will say a lot of the information out there is somewhat conflicting. yes, you read some things that suggest that perhaps the consumer is starting to bargain, hunt a little bit more or making some different decisions. i think everybody read a few of the retailers' releases this week and saw a little bit of that, though that seemed to be more limited to general merchandise and not as applicable to food. but nevertheless, we know what the inflationary environment is like and there certainly could be a shift in behavior with this next round of pricing.
but we won't know until we get there. the important thing is that, thus far, we've seen a pretty healthy consumer. steve, do you want to take price/mix?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
sure. ryan, we typically, as you know, don't split price/mix in our reporting. but as we said in our prepared comments, the significant majority or vast majority of that increase on the price/mix line actually came from pricing. so i think it would be safe to assume that the vast majority is price.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
and then in terms of the eps guidance coming down a little bit, understandably given all the inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, you were talking about the impact falling a little bit more heavily into 2q versus 3q. i was wondering if you'd be able to provide any color on that.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. sure, ryan. the price increase that we're implementing won't be effective until june 6, but we're already experiencing the higher cost and we have the packaging disruption that we mentioned. now the greater part of the impact is due to the pricing lag and less due to the packaging effect.
but come june 6, for the remainder of the quarter, we'll have the benefit of that additional pricing. so it's really due to a combination of price lag and the packaging disruption we mentioned.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
and the last one for me, in terms of understanding what kind of incrementality there has been from work from home, is there anything you've done in terms of survey work to understand how much bigger the breakfast or lunch occasion now is that you can service with respect to your products?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so what we've witnessed, ryan, is a shift within the category, and i think we've mentioned this on some prior calls, to specialty buns enrolled-type products to breakfast, and a lot of that driven by work from home and also a shift to more premium items away from that traditional sort of 20-ounce loaf segment. though we're still strong there and we're still quite large there, obviously, with nature's own, we have seen a shift in the category out to those more premium, more differentiated items. and the good news is, is that has held up, at least, so far even in this challenging environment.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
right. that's just for me.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.

our next question comes from powers with deutsche bank. your line is open.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right. thanks. hey. good morning.
so ryals, just following up on the first question. can you just confirm that the new round of pricing has been accepted across the board? just confirm also if your guidance contemplates a more adverse reaction to that next round of pricing than we may have seen so far? and then i wanted to ask, kind of loop back on -- in the wake of walmart and target this week. as you kind of alluded to, there's been a ton of focus on not only elevated concerns around eroding demand and elasticity. but kind of embedded in my question is concerns about increasing retailer pushback to further price increases and the prioritization of private label assortment across a number of categories.
and against that backdrop, your results, your forward commentary just kind of stand in opposition to those concerns. so can you just maybe give some perspective on that? and recognizing past trends right up through this first quarter, just what gives you confidence that you can kind of ride and really double down on that premiumization momentum going forward into what i think increasingly, people feel as maybe everyone feels, a much more uncertain future?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
sure. steve, thanks for the question. so as far as the pricing acceptance goes, we have not had any issues there. most of our pricing is in and planned -- that was planned for june 6.
so there's really no issue there from our standpoint. so we're confident we can get it all in. so that's number one. number two, as far as private label goes, just going back to some of our prior conversations, as you know, private label's been declining in our category for a long time, and it's still declining.
though i will say the declines are less severe than we've seen in past quarters, but it still has been down. i recognize that there's been a little bit of private label growth in broader food, but we're not seeing that in our category right now. i keep coming back to the point of differentiation within our category. private label are generally very basic items.
we offer a range of items at a range of price points, in a range of channels that are greatly differentiated from private label. i am not in any way suggesting that if we happen to enter a recession or something like that, there won't be some level of trade down. but as you saw from our prepared remarks, as we look back to the last recessionary period, we really didn't see a lot of that in our category. and on top of that, our industry is much different than it was back during that 2008 to 2011 or '12 period, right? you've got a much more consolidated industry, there's been a lot of innovation in the category.
we now have dave's and canyon and nature's own perfectly crafted, etc., that we did not have back then. our market share is much higher than it was back then. so even if there is some level of trade down, i feel very confident in our ability to weather any kind of demand environment. remember, we are in a stable and stable category.
this is typically a weekly purchase item for many, many consumers. and you add to that the continued work from home trends that we're seeing. i think we've got a nice backdrop for continued good performance. as far as retailers prioritizing private label, we have not seen that.
i've seen some commentary from retailers that suggest that they're not doing that. and again, we certainly haven't seen it. there seems to still be focus on branded items in the category, and thankfully, we've got good brands to fill that space.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. very helpful. can you just maybe -- can you confirm or frame for us what kind of degree of, i guess, worsening environment is embedded in your guidance? and then, i guess, i left from your prepared remarks. you were pretty clear around sort of the 2q, 3q dynamics, rising inflationary headwinds, supply chain disruption and the pricing that's rolling in, leading to that $0.05 impact.
but i guess i'm not as clear as to where you expect the year to end. i guess i'm really thinking about it from a gross margin perspective. because while you presumably have that full pricing in place by the fourth quarter and supply chain issues resolved, costs are likely to keep rising. so i guess how should we think about the margin profile of the business exiting '22?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
sure, steve. this is steve. when you look kind of -- i'll talk about it maybe from the cadence of guidance. as we've said early in the year and now it's really embedded in our forecast because our coverage levels have ramped up, but our costs continue to rise and escalate primarily through the third quarter and then they stabilize somewhat, although they will be at a higher level in q4.
then from a comps perspective, it will be an easier comp when -- by the time you get to the back here -- back of the year. so as the year progresses, you will more than likely see some pressure on margin. but as ryals said, we believe we've priced to offset and mitigate as much of that as possible. and then you layer on the cost initiatives that we've talked about for a couple of quarters now.
that also allows us to offset some of the inflationary pressure we're seeing. a lot of those initiatives come in the back half so you will not really begin to see that ramp up until we're out of q2. and then specifically, with the nickel around pricing and packaging, as we said, that should abate somewhat from a packaging perspective. as we move into q3, we feel like we have a good plan in place to mitigate that.
and so far, we're seeing that plan in action and things are beginning to look somewhat better, so we still like -- we've given ourselves from a guidance perspective, what we need to work through that issue. so the reality is this is going to be a full year challenge, kind of all hands on deck. but we do feel like the way we forecast and the way we planned and the way we've thought about kind of elasticities as prices continue to ramp, we have all that built into our guidance.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. thank you very much. i'll pass. thanks.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve.

our next question comes from mitch pinheiro with sturdivant & co. your line is open.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, ryals. so first on the supply chain issues. i realize you've talked about plastic bags and things.
but what are the specific issues are you seeing pressure on or disruptions and creating inefficiencies?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
mitch, for us, it's primarily been packaging. we've had a few raw material-type issues, but nothing that i would call out as being terribly significant. it's really been on the bags primarily for -- obviously, for our bread items and then a couple of items in cake. but again, we're working through that.
i have complete confidence that we'll be through it in the third quarter. but hence, again, the reason we call out the nickel impact.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
and with the bag, i mean, is it a situation where your suppliers -- there's obviously problems with your suppliers? i mean, is this -- how -- why are bags short?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it was sort of a combination of factors. but suffice it to say, there is plenty of inventory or capacity, i should say, in the system that we've identified and are moving to. so we'll actually be spreading our risk around even more than it was before.
so we'll be -- we'll actually come out of this in a much better situation than we went into it. it was a variety of factors that backed things up. i can't point to one single one. but again, with the actions that we're taking, we'll be -- from a supplier diversification standpoint, we'll be in a much better shape than we were prior.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then so as we sort of perhaps see the end of inflation pressure and you've taken all your pricing, and i know we talked -- a lot of the questions here are about elasticity. but do you expect when we get to the other end of this period here, that price -- your list pricing holds and we go to a little more promotional environment or -- and would you prefer that because you can -- your promotions can drive accelerated volume? or would you rather it be sort of a stable list environment with modest promotional activity? how -- what's best for flowers?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. look, for me -- it's a great question, mitch. for me, i would rather the promotional environment remain stable. and we've needed to increase our margins in this business for a long time, as you well know.
and so my hope would certainly be that the consumers are able to accept the price increase, that the price increase holds and that the promotional environment remains rational. that would be the best for our business.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then still impressive to see your brands gaining share, and i'm curious where that's coming from. is it coming from store brands? is there -- are there any regional differences that are noteworthy in your share gains?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there is one that i'll call out. i mean, we continue to perform exceptionally well in the northeast. i'm really proud of that performance.
as you know, we put -- you've seen a lot of our commercials, i think you've mentioned before. and we put a lot of investment behind that because, as you know, our national share is 17.9%, 18% depending on what quarter you look at, whereas in the northeast, we're about 10%, one or two now, i think, but it was zero not too long ago. and we continue to increase that share kind of across all of our categories. so the investment is paying off.
nature's own, particularly perfectly crafted, dave's killer bread, canyon, they all continue to gain share. and those -- we're talking about premium items here. and as i mentioned, it's really encouraging to me to see that unit growth along with the price increase.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then just one more. on the foodservice side, you spoke, i guess, a quarter or two ago about sort of setting new margin thresholds in foodservice and holding the line on pricing and not accepting unfavorable deals. and how does that strategy carry?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
it's coming along well. i also said it's a bit of a long-term project because some of our foodservice volume is under contract. and so we have to work through those contractual terms to fully get to where we want to be. but in the areas where we've been able to take action, we have, and it is starting to improve things.
now the inflation situation does cloud it a little bit because in foodservice, there's sometimes even more of a pricing lag because the contracted business, you follow the cadence of the contract. and so you may be experiencing inflation, but the price increase doesn't come until the contract says it comes. so there is a little bit of that going on. but where we've been able to take action, where we're not under contract, it's been very beneficial to have those margin thresholds set that the team is fully aligned or working toward.
so over time, i expect to see those foodservice margins start to come up again.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much. 
operator
our next question is from ben bienvenu with stephens. your line is open.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
morning. i want to ask about your portfolio optimization strategy and you talk about whittling away at your lower-margin skus. as you think about that strategy, are you purely looking at all of your lower-margin skus and removing those strategically from the portfolio? or are you retaining some of your higher demand low-margin skus? how do you think about that balance between where the margin versus the demand critical mass is at?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. good question. so there are some of our lower-margin products that we would describe as more strategic in the sense that in partnership with some of our retailers having that store brand business, for example, gives us preferential space for our brands, where that's not the case. our intent is to get those margins improved, whether that's through a combination of pricing, distribution methods, efficiencies on our end, etc.
but if we're not able to get that up to the correct threshold, then we have the option to thoughtfully exit that business and then convert that capacity, as i've mentioned on previous calls, to our higher margin-branded business, which we've been doing for the last several years. it's really been beneficial for us.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
got it. ok. makes sense. and then with respect to your capex guidance, came down a little bit.
you talked about product raw material toward your [inaudible] production platform. to what extent are you seeing that in your capex projects pipeline? and how are you navigating that environment?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
can you repeat that? the first part of that broke up a little bit.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
sure. just the revision lower of your capex guidance, how much of that has to do with production or labor challenges or material challenges versus just timing differences?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
i mean the reality is the vast majority is probably more timing. when we look at the bakery optimization that we've been talking about now for a couple of years, some of those projects, as we continue to evaluate where that needs to happen, we have pushed somewhat on the timing. so it will probably take us into out of this year into next year. so it's really mostly timing-related.
i mean, we're pretty much on track when it comes to the largest project going on right now around erp plus and digital. those are coming in about where we thought. it's really around some of the optimization. but it really has nothing to do with availability of supply.
it's more of just kind of a push from a timing perspective.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then my last question. i know it's early days, but the dkb bars, you talked about promising feedback trends there.
is that mostly a market share gain opportunity? or do you think there's an opportunity for distribution gains in the new channels as well [inaudible] stores or otherwise?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we absolutely think there's some distribution opportunities there. and yes, look, i was careful to note it's early days, but the results in the test markets were really, really good and they did exceed our expectations. and it's a wonderful position to be in because it's the rare brand that can move across segments.
and dave's has proven that it can do it, right? it moved out of load bread into breakfast and then breakfast and the buns, and now we're jumping into the healthy snacking category. and our retail partners are really excited about it, consumers are really excited about it. as i mentioned, we've got a pipeline of things coming behind that. so it's early, but it's incumbent upon us to find new revenue streams for this business.
we all know that in sort of the mainline low segment, the category dynamics are a little bit tough there. we also know that as well as dkb and canyon have performed in their core segments. over time, you got to expect those growth rates are going to start to come down a little bit. and so it's incumbent upon us to identify new revenue streams, and that's what we're doing with these great brands that we have.
so i've called it out specifically because we are so optimistic about it.
ben bienvenu -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
yeah. ok. very good. great.
thanks. best of luck. thank you.

our next question comes from bill chappell with truist securities. your line is open.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey. sorry, i got a little bit late on the call, so some of this might have been asked. but in particular as you're looking across the kind of trade down, if any, so would you expect it -- i mean, not as it's having today. but as you kind of look six months, nine months out, would you expect it to go to the opening price point private label or just be more trade down within your brands? and do you not expect much at all if we go to a greater recession?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we talked a little bit about this earlier, but i don't mind repeating some of it. if you look back to the last recessionary period, we actually saw not a whole lot of trade down to private label. we've also mentioned that in the past that we play across a variety of price points, from private label all the way up to super premium and everything in between, right? you've got private label.
you've got wonder. you've got nature's own. you've got dave's. you've got canyon.
so we're -- there's something for everybody there. but if history is a guide, i would not expect a tremendous amount of trade down to private label. i also mentioned, bill, that the industry is quite different now than it was during that last recessionary period. the industry is more consolidated.
our company is stronger. we have a much stronger market share than we did during that last period, and we've got a much stronger portfolio of brands that are significantly differentiated from private label. and consumers continue to show a preference for those products. so my outlook would be that while we may see some trade down to private label, that would only be natural, particularly if we entered a recession, for example.
i think that flowers is well-positioned to hold up very well in that environment.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and again, this might have been asked. but i guess, walmart yesterday kind of highlighted bread, milk, cheese, other things that they really wanted to keep prices low. i think some people took away the thought that they might start pushing back more on incremental price increases from here.
i know you're not going to talk about individual customers. but i mean, do you feel like it's getting -- going to be tougher to pass off incremental prices with retail? is your business different just because it's such vendor-managed inventory and scan-based kind of price that it's a little bit different than some other packaged food? any color there would be great.
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i do think that we're a little bit different just given the service levels that we provide to the retailer, obviously being dsd. i also think that it helps, i'll mention it again, the strength of the brands. i mean, i don't think you want to be in a position where you've got a no.
4 brand right now. and so having a portfolio of no. 1 brands certainly does help. i don't know what the retailers will do in the future.
what i can tell you is that for our june 6 price increase, there's been no issue there for us.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. no. that helps. and then last one for me.
just as i kind of look out at use of cash since some of the capex has been pushed out, is there anything else you can do in terms of -- do you pull forward looking at m&a? do you pull forward other projects? or is it just this is the kind of the way capex works. it takes a little bit longer, especially on some construction projects in this time?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
sure. i mean the reality is from an overall capital allocation perspective, i would say really nothing changes in our thought process with the slight pullback from a capital perspective. obviously, you've heard ryals talk about m&a. we continue to have a pretty strong pipeline from that perspective.
it's just a matter of valuation and timing. so that's always a consideration. and then as we look at other ways to use our cash, whether it's dividends or stock repurchases, i'd say we're sticking pretty true to our philosophical views there. so i don't anticipate that changing.
so really, the pull back from a capital perspective is timing. so it's not like we've eliminated projects. it's more of a shift maybe between years. so i don't think you'll see us do anything dramatically different than what you've seen in the past.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. i'm sorry, one last question. would you say foodservice business is kind of back to where it was in 2019? or are we still building back to that?
ryals mcmullian -- president and chief executive officer
bill, we're still building back to it. it's improving, but still below pre-pandemic for us. but remember also that some of the disruptions that we had during the quarter would have impacted that volume a little bit, too, so it's a mix of both.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from bill chappell with truist. your line is open.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, ryals, you had mentioned in prepared remarks a little bit about, i guess, one competitor being a little bit slower to raise prices. and i don't know if that was just a timing issue. and maybe discuss any changes in terms of the competitive landscape of pricing. or is everybody, for the most part, kind of moving up with commodities and input costs and what have you? and then your kind of thought as -- i think you also had thought that inflation would start to peak by october in terms of what you're looking at.
so, maybe a little more color there would be great. thanks.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
sure, happy to do that. i'll let steve handle the inflation question. but with regard to pricing, it wasn't so much the other competitors were late raising price. it's just that, bill, we went in a little bit earlier than normal.
so, i would say that, you know, most of the rest of the industry was relatively on time as far as typical, you know, times to raise prices in the industry. but we went in june a little bit earlier. and so, you know, what you ended up with were, you know, price gaps that were, you know, a little bit larger than, you know, historical gaps. and i think we commented that, you know, that impacted our unit share a little bit in the quarter.
but since then, you know, most of the industry has followed and raised prices as we have. steve, you want to touch on inflation?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah, bill. so, you know, we have said that q3, we'll see our highest overall cost from an inflationary standpoint. it will moderate somewhat in q4, but again, it still will be elevated in q4.
but the peak of that happens in q3 and then it starts to pull back slightly.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then separately, just on acquisition/innovation, can you give us a little more color, and sorry, the name of the company is escaping me, of the investment you made in the quarter? i guess i would have expected normally you to buy outright those type of businesses. so, kind of partnering with a small business and what that brings to the portfolio. and then i'll leave it at that and let others ask questions on other innovation.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, bill. yeah. the name of the company is base culture.
they are gluten-free and grain-free baked foods company, so it's all keto- and paleo-certified. very much on trend. the reason that we took more of a venture approach to this is that base culture is much, much earlier in their growth cycle than even like a dave's killer bread was back in 2015. and, you know, we've been looking for some time to start doing venture-type, minority-type investments to bolster our own internal agile innovation efforts.
and this one just fit very nicely with our portfolio on where we're trying to go as far as, you know, healthier eating, you know, on-trend attributes like keto and paleo, which we don't really have much of an offering in right now. so, we're quite excited about. small investment but -- and small company, but we're quite excited about the prospects.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
and when should we start to see, i guess, wider distribution of their products? and then is there an option to own the company outright down the road?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, there is. and it will be helping them not only with their production because, obviously, we have that skill set, and they don't. they're a very small organization.
but also sales and distribution opportunities. so, we're already working in that regard.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
so, i would see the products in the next couple of quarters everywhere? or is that too quick?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
you know, it'll probably take a little bit longer than that for it to be everywhere. again, they're really small. but we'll grow them in a way that they can, you know, they can absorb with their production capacity, which, you know, eventually will need to be expanded.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. i'll turn it over. thanks so much.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, bill.

our next question comes from robert dickerson with jefferies. your line is open.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks so much. maybe just a question for you, steve. first, i think you just said, i think, costs may have peaked in q2, still high q3, q4.
in the prepared remarks, seems like you're essentially almost fully hedged for the year in ingredients side, i'm assuming. so, if we think about kind of that margin cadence, i guess, inclusive of mix in the back half, you know, is there should be kind of this implied expectation for ebitda to actually grow, i guess, in the second half? and then maybe just explain if that's what -- you know, it sounds like it's a little bit more q4-weighted. then i have a quick follow up.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, just one quick correction there. we said q3 would be our highest cost quarter.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
right, yeah.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
cost continues to, you know, coming in to q3. it will pull back some in q4, but for the most part, you know, people will remain -- will be elevated as well, just not quite to the level as q3. and you're right, you know, in the back half, we have said a lot of our initiatives come into play. you know, we have the pricing to mitigate a lot of the inflation, but we do have, you know, several cost savings initiatives, as well as productivity initiatives that are in flight.
and, you know, from a cadence perspective, we said those will come in q3, q4. so that will, you know, be a big driver of the ebitda in the back half.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
and, rob, just to put a number on that, we're still in the range of that 25 million to 35 million. all of which is back half.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, great. yeah. and, you know, i realized that because i think there's a line in the prepared remarks that said as you got through the second quarter, you actually started to see ebitda improve. so, it sounds like maybe that was also a function of maybe some of the more of the pricing and some of the productivity coming through in the kind of latter part of the quarter.
is that fair?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and remember, too, i don't know if this was clear from the prepared remarks, but there's still more pricing that will continue to come in. steve, roughly through the third quarter, right?
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
yeah.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
most of it's in, but there is still more rolling in primarily in food service. so, that will also help, too, rob.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. super. and then just quickly on dkb, obviously, it sounds like, yeah, there is a little bit of supply constraint in the quarter. seems like that's essentially been fixed now.
and then you also have the new west coast facility. so, kind of bigger picture, you know, if we're thinking it through kind of back half of this year and really on the go-forward from there, you view -- i mean, well, let's say, you're not going to quantify what the opportunity is in the west coast with dkb, but my assumption is that would still be kind of an ongoing driver of the business, maybe outside of what you see on the rest of the business. so, any incremental color there would be great.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, no question about it, rob. i mean, we still -- we're still so confident in dkb and its growth prospects. we were hampered a bit by the packaging issues that we had in the second quarter for dkb, but also those capacity constraints which, you know, are now resolved. those capacity constraints, you know, we don't promote dkb that much, but we were so constrained we weren't able to do much at all.
and so, that, you know, hurt the units a bit. now that we have henderson up and running, we can, you know, go back to what we have been doing historically, driving the growth of dkb out west. you know, even still, though, i do want to point out, and i don't know if we mentioned this in the prepared remarks or not, but, you know, even though dkb was slightly pressured in the quarter from both from a unit standpoint, the breakfast segment for dkb was outstanding in the quarter. and as you know, that's been a key area of focus for us since we're underpenetrated there.
so, that was one highlight for dkb on the quarter that we'll call out.
rob dickerson -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. super. thanks so much. i'll pass it on.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from ben bienvenu with stephens. your line is open.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, guys. jim salera on for ben. good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i wanted to ask, ryals, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned you are seeing, you know, lower-income consumers trade down to less expensive, which is kind of, you know, on par with the expectations. but then for higher-income consumers, they had actually been increasing their purchases with the premium products. can you just maybe drill down on that a little bit and see or talk about what's driving that? because we would think that, you know, everyone just kind of shifts, parallel shift down to the fact that they're increasing is, i would say, countercyclical to what you would expect.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. there's a lot to talk about there, really. i don't think there's going to be a lot of questions about elasticity. so, this is as good a time as any to talk about it.
there's quite a few sort of competing data points out there that we're looking at. you know, on the one hand, you know, we saw private label gain a little bit of unit share, 10 basis points of unit share. but if you look at the overall private label units, they were down almost 8 million units in the quarter. so, a lot of that private label share growth was being driven in mass.
and what we've seen in mass is retail prices being held down, which, you know, kind of creates a bit more of a gap than you might have historically seen. if you look at the grocery channel sort of x mass, private label loss share again in the quarter. and in that channel, the price gaps were much more in line with, you know, historical averages than what we're seeing in mass. turning to dkb, specifically, dkb's unit declines were primarily in california and the mass channel.
and they were -- as you pointed out, they were concentrated more among lower-income households. but dkb grew units and share in the northeast and nationwide among higher-income households, which you might expect. and product trips also increased nationwide among both middle- and higher-income households. but then a caveat to that is we are seeing even those higher-income households seek a bit more value from the mass and club channels.
so, you can see there's a little bit of yin and yang there. when we're looking at the data, i think it's still early days. but the takeaway is that, you know, given the environment and i read everybody saw the news yesterday, you know, growth, grocery prices up 13.1%, the highest since 1979. and yet, you know, we still perform very, very well in that environment.
nature's own units were up. canyon units were up. yes, our volumes were down, but quite a bit of that is our own portfolio optimization and sku rationalization we're doing. and our volume declines were right in line with our expectations.
so, overall, when you look at the total picture, even though there are some sort of conflicting data points out there. we were very, very pleased with how our brands and the company performed in the quarter.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
if i can follow up on that, do you think it's because the price point is still so accessible just in dollar terms that, you know, if everything's up, you know, a 13% change on a $2 item is obviously a lot lower than a 13% change on a $20 item. is it just that there's nowhere else for the consumer to go, and so it's easy to make a $3 indulgent purchase than a $30 one or, you know --
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, i certainly -- i think it's part of it. you know, we've said many, many times, i mean, when you think about an inflationary environment, bread is still a very, very economical choice, just given the number of servings in a loaf, right? and furthermore, you know, even though prices have increased, we play across all the price points from super premium dave's killer bread and canyon, you know, all the way down to private label. so, you know, there's -- simply put, there's something for everybody there.
there's something for, you know, every household income, every household budget.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then if you guys could give us -- you mentioned real briefly in the prepared remarks the baby bars test. if you could just give us a little bit more commentary on, you know, consumer reception of that and maybe, you know, channels that it worked in better or worse, and just how we're thinking about the rollout of that.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, it's still early days for that. we're still in test market, but we're working toward national distribution on the first three skus. and as we said in the prepared remarks, we're wildly excited about the results that we've seen so far.
it's just further testament to the dkb brand and what it stands for and the quality and the story behind it, etc. so, we're very excited about it. and further news, not in the prepared remarks, we've recently launched three additional skus that are high-protein, which the original three were not, to add to that. then we're also putting in the test markets and quite excited about it as well.
so, not resting on our laurels. you know, we continue to innovate with dkb and one of the reasons we continue to be excited about its growth prospects going forward.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. great. when do we -- when should we expect to see the first handful of skus out, you know, kind of in stores across the country?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. early next year.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. perfect. thanks, guys. i'll pass it on.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from connor rattigan with consumer edge research. your line is open.
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for the question.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
good morning. hi. so, i guess just on the mix shift more toward private label in the quarter, i was wondering if you can address the market implications of that shift. just, i guess, how much of the 240-basis-point decline was attributable to that mix shift? and i guess, also, sort of just following up on ben's question, would it be a reasonable assumption that maybe in the next few quarters the portfolio remains slightly more oriented toward private label versus 2021?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
so, private label definitely went up in the quarter. but remember, that's virtually all price. you know, i've already mentioned that the units were down in the category, 8 million units and that's a good thing. as we've mentioned on prior calls, we've been working diligently to improve the margin profile of our lower-margin business, which is, generally speaking, the private label and food service businesses.
and we've taken significant price to mitigate these inflationary headwinds in both of those businesses. now, certainly, there's still lower margin than branded retail. and the pressures we're feeling on gross margin from, you know, ingredients, packaging, freight, bags, you know, you name it, you know, is certainly impacting us on the gross margin line. but, you know, steve can comment further.
we have done a good job, i think, leveraging sg&a and that's come down as a percentage of sales.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
right. i mean, i would say, overall, the inflationary pressures probably drive more of the margin pressure than the mix shift because even though it's happening, it's still not -- you know, we've said it's still not meaningful at this point. we continue to monitor that. so, a lot of the margin pressure really is coming from the inflation on input cost, transportation, labor more than the mix itself.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. the one other thing i would add to that, connor, that's exactly why it's more important than ever for us to maintain our marketing and brand support investments. because, you know, as we said, we said it last quarter, i mean, in this kind of environment, i mean, you've got to expect some amount of trade-down, you know, particularly among lower-income households. but lower-income households, believe it or not, are 20% of dave's killer bread units.
kind of surprising even to me when i first heard that. but, you know, continuing to support the brands, continuing to be out there from a marketing standpoint, keeping those brands front and center, you know, we will get through this eventually. and when we do, we want those consumers, obviously, to come back to the brands they love.
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
mmm hmm. thanks. that was helpful. and i guess just a follow up to that, too, just the question about the phoenix bakery closure.
so, in the prepared remarks, you guys commented that it's, you know, i guess it's an older lower-margin bakery that services more private label products. i guess just why the decision to close it now? i mean, was this like a long-running plan? or i mean, just i guess, given the increased private label demand you saw in the quarter.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
so yeah, phoenix is an older, much less-efficient bakery. this is all part of our network optimization plans that we've been talking about for several years now. and, you know, alongside that, we did exit some lower-margin private label and food service business out there. and we have plenty of capacity to take over what remains and ample capacity to fund future growth, so we can take care of all of our remaining business.
but, you know, as we execute our portfolio strategy, you know, it can have network optimization implications as well. and that's what you saw with phoenix.
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. i'll pass it on.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from steve powers with deutsche bank. your line is open.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
i want to go back to what you were seeing or what you have been seeing in terms of the different tactics in terms of private label pricing mass versus grocery and how you think that evolves. do ultimately mass prices move higher because the cost picture demands it? or, you know, this is business risk creating some kind of competitive dynamic where grocery prices, you know, move lower to compete with mass. and then we have sort of downward pressure on the category. how are you thinking about that evolution?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
well, we certainly haven't seen that yet. and i can't speak to, you know, why certain retailers are doing what they're doing. you know, all we can do is execute on our plans. and i would -- obviously, we hope, you know, they'll come up and some of those gaps will close a bit.
but it's certainly hard for me to predict what they're going to do.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
but again, as we mentioned so far -- so far, we haven't, you know, we haven't seen this in grocery. and again, you know, private label lost share in grocery.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. yeah. and it's not -- and as you say, you still have some pricing, you know, set to come in. it's not -- nothing that you're seeing has really altered your own strategy from a pricing standpoint or your own expectations in terms of price realization.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
it has not.
steve powers -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. ok. very good. thank you.
thank you very much.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from mitchell pinheiro with sturdivant & co. your line is open.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
yeah. hey, good morning.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, mitch.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
hey. i had a question. you talked about price increases and ahead of competition, which seemed to trim a little bit of volume in the quarter. and, you know, is pricing -- i mean, it seems to suggest that it's, you know, that maybe, you know, this is certainly a commodity-type product if, you know, merely, you know, a price increase a couple of weeks or a month ahead of the competition is going to affect volume that much.
why is it that -- was it a very large price increase relative to the competition? or, you know, why would it be that dramatic?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, it it's not in terms of magnitude of our price increases versus, you know, competitors price increases. it was just that, you know, in this environment when you start getting gaps, you know, that much larger, that can affect behavior somewhat. that's not the only thing that affected units in the quarter.
and we talked about, you know, supply chain issues, etc., but it certainly was a factor. you know, we also caught a hurricane, which we haven't mentioned yet. and we typically perform very well. so, there were other things other than that, but it certainly had, you know, at least some effect on the quarter.
but that's, you know, that's all much more normalized at this point.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and how did food service do in the quarter?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
from a top-line standpoint, really, really well. so, if you look at it from a pre-pandemic standpoint year to date, you know, in terms of sales dollars, the food service business has recovered, but the units are still below pre-pandemic.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
and is that -- are units below across the board or in one particular segment like qsr or fast casual?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
i'd have to look. i want to say it was a little bit lower in quick serve.
steve kinsey -- chief financial officer
qsr was more challenged.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and is there a reason for that? is it just traffic in the qsr customers? or, you know, is there anything going on underneath that?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think it's just, mitch, i think it's just a bit more normalization coming out of the pandemic. remember, quick serve actually did pretty well during the pandemic just because of, you know, less contact. but now that people are more comfortable going back to restaurants, i think that's why you're seeing that shift. but that's also good for us because our margins were higher in those other segments.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
right. and then, you know, you had, you know, i don't know, it seems like about six quarters of lower volume growth. um, when does that stop? when are we going to see sku rationalization slow down as an impact on your results? and if you could talk about that a little bit, it'd be helpful.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, i think, generally speaking, we've done the bulk of what we want to do for now. i mean, obviously, you know, sku rats are, you know, kind of a continual process. but i think in large measure, you know, we've cleaned out most of the underperforming items that we wanted to simplify operations, simplify our sales execution for that matter, and, you know, get to the business of growing volumes.
you know, i think innovation remains key for that. and so, obviously, our goal over time is to not only grow dollars but continue growing our unit share as well. so, we're focused on that.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
so, if we look at the third quarter, i mean, are we going to still see some year-over-year volume declines in the overall business?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, mitch, embedded in the eps guidance is an assumption around mainly elasticities. and as i've said so far, year to date, we're running right about where we thought we would be. so, i think it's reasonable to assume that trend to continue through the year.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. and then could you talk about specifically about some of the cost savings programs that you are currently, you know, initiating and how they're going to flow through the second half?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, that's that 25 million to 35 million. and it's a mix of benefits from our digital investments that we've made, which we expect in the back half. we talked a little bit about bakery in the future.
and then so that's bakery improvement in the digital sense. there are also separate bakery improvement projects, initiatives that are underway, and also procurement. so, those are sort of the three big areas that the savings will come from.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
and as you look next year, does any of that carry through into '23?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
yes, it does. we have not quantified that yet. but, yes, it does.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
and then i guess, finally, just when it comes to regional variations in your business, is there any -- which where the best-performing region and which were the worst-performing regions geographically?
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
so, the northeast continues to be a call out for us. you know, as you know, we've put a lot of focus up there, and it continues to pay dividends for us. you know, we did have a couple of regions that underperformed by our standards, but i would submit to you that was more operational performance-driven than it was top-line sales performance-driven.
mitch pinheiro -- sturdivant and company -- analyst
ok. that's all i have. thank you for your time.
ryals mcmullian -- vice chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thank you, mitch.
operator
there are no further questions. i will turn the call back over to ryals mcmullian for any closing remarks.
