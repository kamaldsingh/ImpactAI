we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from david manthey from baird. please go ahead.
david manthey -- baird -- analyst
yeah. good morning and happy new year, everyone.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, dave. happy new year. 
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hi, dave.
david manthey -- baird -- analyst
yeah, hi. so first question, kind of big picture, could you outline the role of technology in the mission critical effort? i mean, if -- if you're cutting costs and you hope to maintain or improve the productivity and customer service of msc, how are you doing that? can you give us a couple of examples?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, dave. i -- i -- i think it's -- it's so good question, and what i would say is just the way on the growth side we described sales force as an enabler. you know, the expansion of the sales force as something that enables each of the five initiatives. you know, technology is underpinning everything we're doing.
and that's -- that's on the cost side. it's on the growth side. so on the growth side -- and i'll get to your question on cost on the growth side, heavy investment into pricing analytics as we have talked about as one of the five levers heavy investment into pricing analytics that we're beginning to see translate in the form of improved price realization on the gross margin line. and then of course, yes heavy emphasis on using technology to power some of the structural cost initiatives, and i think what's most significant there is the cost takeout here.
this is not an exercise of just stripping costs out of the business. this is an exercise in -- in -- in improving how we do things. so you know, a perfect example of that is what kristen just mentioned, with -- with our move in melville. yes, it was a downsizing of the building but really what we're doing is rethinking the way we work and using technology to do it.
so it's moving to a hybrid work model. and obviously, for all of us, technology has been at the core of that and you know not only does that open up productivity gains, it allows us to shrink real estate footprint, it allows us to rethink travel and how often we need to get together. but -- but it opens up talent pools in new locations that we're not wed to melville for instance that we can recruit especially in certain functions in other areas so that would be an example, dave. but i think what you'd see if you go project by project across the three big buckets: sales and service, supply chain and g&a, and technology underpinning a lot of it.
david manthey -- baird -- analyst
ok, thank you for that. and then just to clarify one thing on slide no. 5 where you say that nonsafety sales were down year to year but improved sequentially each month. when you say improved, are you talking about dollars there, is that average daily sales growth rates? what is the improvement you're referring to?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
that would be an improvement in our average daily sales rate, dave.
david manthey -- baird -- analyst
perfect. all right, thank you very much.

our next question is from john inch from gordon haskett. please go ahead.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
thank you, good morning, everyone. happy new year.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi john, happy new year.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
thank you. so let me start, erik and kristen. raw material costs have been going up. have you seen that reflected in the prices of your purchased products, and how, erik, are you thinking about the annual price increase, and maybe you could talk about just supplier pricing actions and trends in general.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
john, so you're right. what you're pointing out is something we have -- our sourcing folks have their -- their eyes on closely, particularly as it relates to metals. what i would tell you is to date, it's been a little early to see it translated. as -- as -- as you know in following us for a while, one of the real triggers for us is seeing the commodities movements translate into supplier -- supplier list increases, which have -- have not yet come in earnest.
we do -- we do expect, though, that that's going to build should the inflation sustain. as of now, our thinking is we would expect to implement a price increase. timing-wise, it's still a little early, but figure roughly end of q2, beginning of q3 is kind of what we're thinking now. and john, the only other thing i'll point out is if -- if you look in our growth decomposition, you'll see we're -- we're -- we're seeing improved price realization.
the most recent increase we took was back over the summer. it was in the 1% range, so it was pretty modest given the low inflation at the time. so we're encouraged, we've invested a lot into price, you know, sort of price execution, price analytics, and we think we're starting to see that in the form of improved realization.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
so just based on your answer, it's too soon to tell if the rising raw material costs are going to translate into higher product costs? what's -- what's traditionally the lag, and -- and are your competitors raising prices yet or are they also kind of waiting and seeing?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so generally there is a lag, and it will depend on how -- you know, it -- it -- it's usually a several month lag. it depends on -- exactly when depends on how fast they snap back, and of course i think it would have to be sustained for a bit of time before our manufacturers pass it along. we -- we watch pricing carefully. i would say to date, we've not seen a lot of movement, but history would suggest that if what we're seeing now in inflation does hold, that it would yield increases coming from our suppliers and it's a matter of time.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
no, that makes sense. and then just as a follow-up question, erik. so the 400 basis points of targeted market outgrowth, does your plan provide for a more granular breakdown, say by targeted industry, so some aspects government might be more than 400, some less? if so -- i'm assuming that's the case. can you give us any details that kind of square up the 400 target?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. so into -- look -- in inside the company, john, we have the 400 broken out a few ways. certainly, by customer type, we have a look. we also have a look by product and service category, and we have another look that's literally down to the geography, the zip code, so at a level by initiative of our five big levers.
we have multiple [inaudible] at it. certainly, there are going to be industries that grow faster than others. what i would say are a couple things. one is you're going to see us -- it -- it's for us, it's a balance.
on the one hand, you're going to see us continue to invest in our core. our core is metalworking and metalworking gets sold into those heavy, you know, manufacturing sectors that have been hit pretty hard. so if you look at the ip numbers, they've been lagging. those heavy metalworking-centric end markets have been lagging.
at some point, when there's a real recovery, those will snap back, and we think we'll benefit in an outsized way by staying focused on that segment. the second piece would be -- you know, the balance, sort of the fifth lever if you will, is diversified end markets and the biggest focus for us right now is -- is the one you touched on, john-government. certainly, you know, we're encouraged by momentum there. that would be one that we would expect to outpace the 400 for sure.
given, you know, its relative size in our portfolio, size of market, and the level of investment we're putting there.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
yeah, you mentioned metalworking in the last call, erik, as a continued focus. so does metalworking grow faster than 400 or is it kind of around the 400, based on your plan?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
you know, look, i think -- i think it'll move around, john, and obviously, it'll be a function of how we execute, how much share we capture. i think, you know, the way we look at it is given our relative -- our relative size in metalworking and market share that we have, if we were growing at 400 basis points above ip and metalworking that would be a pretty good result and would allow us to widen the lead, given the size of the base we're starting with.
john inch -- gordon haskett research -- analyst
 makes sense. thank you. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, john.

our next question comes from hamzah mazari from jefferies. please go ahead.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. happy new year. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, hamzah.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. so -- so my question is just around the -- the reacceleration of market share. and you mentioned there's a new energy building inside the company. you know, maybe you could talk about sort of, you know, how is this restructuring different from a cultural buy-in perspective and then -- and then how conservative are the numbers you've put out there, the 400 basis points, the roic, sort of mid-teens? how -- how do we think about those two items?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hamzah, let me -- let me start with the -- the energy. you know, the que -- question around the energy and there is. i mean, if you're inside the company and -- and -- and right now, by large measure that's inside it virtually, you would feel a change. and -- and what i would say is i'd go back and say look if you -- if you go back over the life of this company or particularly our life as a public company, we're going on 25 years now, the dna of this company is a growth company and one that always stretched and saw itself having goals that were much bigger than where it was at the time.
and look over the past few years, we've been through a lot of changes, we're -- we're coming out the other side of the changes and are reconnecting with that legacy and the idea of thinking big and setting stretch goals. i think that's one of the biggest things is a reconnection with that idea and a leadership team that's embracing -- that's embracing the idea of stretching from [audio gap] and you know, i think that's beginning to trace its way through the organization. you know, so to your point about how conservative are the goals, look -- as  -- as you can imagine, you know, like -- like most things inside the company, we -- we are stretching and you know, for any goal that we're talking to you about, you could imagine that for the group inside of sales is there a higher aspiration? sure, but the group on -- that's focusing on the cost side by area, is there a higher aspiration? sure. because we are trying to build the mentality into the company of stretch and think big.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then just on the -- on the gross cost savings target of $90 million to $100 million, do --do -- do -- you have a sense of how big the reinvestment you're thinking into growth will -- will look like and -- and -- and where you're going to reinvest? i know you've talked about sort of rebuilding the sales force and hunters, you know, 50 i think you said as a number, but -- but just order of magnitude, how much of those gross savings, you know, would be reinvested? and is it going to be all in sales or are there other areas?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so for this year, we're looking at a $15 million reinvestment. that would be for fiscal '21. for '22 and '23, you can definitely look for that annual number to step down.
we're gonna continue to invest. you know, i don't think we've given a specific range where -- i'd say you could probably look for $7 million to $8 million of reinvestment in '22 and '23. that's always changing though as we continue to add more of the pipeline, look at the prioritization of when things come online. as far as where the investment goes, you know, we're focused on the three areas cost out in g&a, supply chain, and sales, and service.
it is an investment really underpinning all three. this year is a bit more focused on the sales and service areas particularly with the digital initiative ramping up very quickly, but you're going to see investment across the board. as erik mentioned a lot of the stuff we're looking at on the cost side is really transformative due and requires investment. so it will be across the board, nearer term that more weighted to sales and service.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you so much. 
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.

the next question is from kevin marek from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
 hi, good morning, everyone. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, kevin.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
can you just update us on what happened in sales in terms of safety versus nonsafety performance? like how did it trend by month of through the quarter, and then obviously, you know, through december?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. we can get your specific numbers. i mean, what i'll do, kevin, is just give you sort of the general picture as to what's going on. is -- you know, it's consistent with what we're seeing in the indices.
like ip -- we -- we are seeing a sequential build in the performance particularly of the base business, and by base i mean nonsafety, nonjanitorial. so if you look at safety and janitorial which is a great proxy for our ppe program through the first quarter that was growing in the low 20s. december stepped up to high 20s, close to 30. but i think the real story is what's been happening in the nonsafety slash janitorial you know the other the core of the business which has been a steady climb up.
so you know, you go back to the teeth of the pandemic. you know, we were talking down i believe it was mid-20s. i mean, you know, in the depths of this thing. and we've been on sort of a gradual a gradual climb up and then you know obviously look we got a nice pleasant surprise in -- in december where they all do the base business was down low single digits.
so you know, one month does not a trend make. it was an encouraging sign. we got some benefit of some -- some cares act spending as -- as -- as that was expiring. but it's been a steady climb up in the base business.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then as a follow-up, you know, is there any gross margin implication that you would call out from the trends you've seen in december as far as two to expectations are concerned? you know, i think typical seasonality maybe doesn't call for much of a change q over q.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. let me -- let me touch on gross margin and i'll -- i'll put it back in the context of kind of the guidance we gave last quarter around the operating margin framework. so what we -- what we told you last quarter on gross margin range thinking about the year is you can expect this to be flat to maybe down 50 bps. the biggest variable there is really a mix driven by the ppe headwinds.
so -- so since then, we've seen a couple of things happen. one, our pricing cost execution has been really strong. like we alluded to for december. i'd say it's as good or better than we had envisioned.
two, we see a higher chance of larger ppe headwinds for a quarter or two. and -- and what's behind that is one we've got a large inventory position on masks -- you know, the virus is surging, we may end up selling through a lot of those. at the same time, it's no surprise to share that mass pricing has come down over the past couple of quarters. but really given the strong price cost performance will still likely fall within that flat to down 50 bps range even with the larger ppe headwind.
i think if the ppe headwind were to become really large, it's possible we could stray outside that -- that down 50 bps range. if that happened, i think what you'll see us do is enact countermeasures whether it's you know on the gross margin line or elsewhere on the piano to mitigate that risk as much as possible, but really trying to still protect that investments that are going to drive the growth both in '21 and beyond. you know, regardless of what happens with ppe it is a temporary headwind. i think in a couple of quarters the underlying price cost dynamic that's what we're most focused on, and we're really pleased with what we see there you know and more broadly we're still very committed to the two overall mission critical targets around the market growth capture and roic improvement.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. understood. thank you. happy new year.

the next question is from michael mcginn from wells fargo. please go ahead.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, morning, everybody. great quarter.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks mike. happy new year.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
happy new year. so i wanted to touch on your annual margin framework. historically, your financials have seen a slow start given the first half seasonality of the business but you were able to meet the low end of your full-year framework on a mid, high single-digit revenue decline. so assuming mix is normalizing and price building momentum to the benefit of your gross margin.
i was just curious, what are your embedded assumptions for sg&a in terms of cost-out opportunity, and maybe what would what factors would push that the high end of the annual framework?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure -- sure. so -- so drilling in a bit on sg&a in terms of the margin framework that we laid out last quarter, our thinking on -- on the operating expenses still holds, really. if you -- if you end up seeing revenue flat to slightly down and you can look for the opex expense to be slightly down as well. and we are on target for that still.
if you -- if you think about kind of what would drive us to the upper end of the overall op margin framework, i'd say you could have one potential where you're looking at potentially overdriving the productivity programs. you know, we're always looking to be more aggressive on -- on things in that department. on the gross margin side, again, we are seeing strong underlying pricing cost performance. i'm not sure that i would say that the mix headwind is behind us yet because we still do have ppe volume moving through and -- and you know, especially in the next couple of quarters.
it's still likely that ppe mix could be a headwind, but i'd say that the operating expenses largely still in line with the framework. you know, gross margin we feel confident we're in that flat down 50 bps range. so if you saw anything advantageous against either of those, those could take us up to the -- the upper end of the range. 
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok, i appreciate that. and then you mentioned some nice trends within milling and the millmax initiative you have. i'm assuming that's catering to your core customer as well as some government. can you remind us what milling and maybe ccsg combined as a percent of your revenue is?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so let me -- let me talk a little bit and, mike, what i'll do is maybe frame for you millmax which is really -- you're right, millmax is powering the core business. the interesting dynamic though is it's powering it in the metalworking category but we see an opportunity to power through other ancillary mro products within the heavy manufacturing sector. so let me explain a little bit. so you know, metalworking in the u.s., we size at $12 billion to $15 billion and it fluctuates based upon what's happening in the market.
you can imagine right now we're spending being down, the economy being soft, that's at the lower end of that. cutting tools as a whole represents 30% to 40% of metalworking. that's been the company's bread and butter for a long time. within the cutting tool universe, milling is one of the biggest app -- applications within cutting tool.
that's where msc millmax is designed to show productivity and -- look, the -- the results in terms of improving customer throughput productivity have been really, really encouraging. so you know, frame there, we believe there's, you know, roughly around 45,000 locations, customer locations in the u.s. that would be candidates for msc millmax and those are -- that's basically the universe of, you know, where we see the right fit of heavy manufacturing that's doing milling applications. the opportunity for us is to go in there and it's not just -- it's to improve a customer's productivity and then as we described, we're -- we're really providing a service and then in exchange for the service, we're asking for incremental market share capture.
in many cases so far, and obviously, it's still very early, what we're seeing though is the market share capture may or may not happen in cutting tools. it may happen in the customer's ancillary spend. so if you go into a typical manufacturing operation, generally, for every dollar of cutting tools they're spending, they're going to spend some multiple of that on mro purchases and sort of that's the bigger opportunity for us. and all of this , obviously, is the power the 400-basis-point outperformance that we're gearing ourselves toward.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and if i -- if i could dig into that a little further, can you maybe touch upon why millmax is important to have in the hand of a distributor versus maybe an oem? because my perception is you're going in, you're providing these services, and you're finding the best and right solutions. so how did that work with your maybe supplier relationships and you're able to provide you know the best product that you know works versus favoring one or another product where an oem might?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, mike so that's -- that's -- it's a great question, and -- and look, i think, i -- i really as much as i love the millmax technology and about what it's doing, i think we are perfectly positioned to be the one to bring this to market. for a couple of reasons. one is the technology by itself is a piece to the puzzle. the end here is about finding productivity and -- and helping customers improve throughput, reduce wasted materials, etc.
to do that, you need the tech. this technology is -- is -- is unique, but by itself it's not enough. you actually need a technical person alongside to interpret the data. somebody who understands machining and metalworking, which obviously we've got the largest national footprint of -- of metalworking tech specialists in our field and in our current customer care centers.
and then on top of that, mike, and this gets to your question about the suppliers. look, suppliers are manufacture -- our suppliers to the manufacturer could do this. here's the challenge they face. ultimately, what this tool does is it brings objectivity and it removes brand preference because it's -- it -- it moves it to performance.
and so the -- the benefit that a customer has by doing business with msc is we're going to give him the right what -- we're going to use to interpret the data and then we're gonna give him the right answer to their problem. and you know, the nice thing there is msc has the broadest and deepest metalworking portfolio in the industry. so i think all three of those components together are what's needed to really maximize value to this thing and i think we're, you know, in a fortunate position to have all three.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thank you. appreciate the time. i'll -- i'll pass it along.

the next question is from adam uhlman from cleveland research. please go ahead.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. happy new year to you all.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning, adam.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
happy new year.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
i was wondering if we could start with a discussion about your hiring plan for the sales force for the rest of the year. i'm -- i'm wondering if you'd be willing to dimension just how many folks you are looking to add to the sales force, and then -- or -- or maybe more of this reinvestment, the $15 million for the year is -- so do you think of that as going forward as being more digital investments and not headcount related?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so -- so adam, i'll -- i'll start. look, we -- we -- let me start with the bigger -- the bigger question on investments, you know, growth investments. we are really focused on this three-year. if i haven't said it enough, the 400 basis points plus, and building momentum along the way.
we've -- we've got five growth levers and we believe all five are critical to hitting the 400 basis points plus, and underpinning that is the sales force expansion, which i'll get to. but again, those five: metalworking, solutions, selling the full portfolio, digital, and diversified segments, which right now is government, you're going to see investment. where the growth investment is going, it's going directly into those five, and then into the sales force that's going to power those five. in terms of the sales force particularly, look, we've -- we've been -- it's been a few years now since we've expanded the sales force.
you know, adam, you -- you've been following our story for a while. we have been through this whole repositioning of the business and -- and we needed to reshape the sales force in order to bring this thing to life. and what that meant was over the last couple of years under eddie's watch, we -- we've taken headcount down because what we -- we found was that we were over-assorted in certain roles, i.e. in farmers, did not have enough in hunters, and some other key roles in metalworking that we're now throttling up, so we're reshaping the sales force.
you saw us add 50 in the first quarter. look, if -- if we can continue hiring the right people as we're doing, we could see that continue at sort of that rate and pace, for the balance of -- plus or minus, for the balance of the fiscal. you know, we -- we'd like to get it where we're back to 2019 levels on what we publish in our sales and service stats by the end of the fiscal. and look, obviously, the idea is we're going to be funding that growth investment --you know, that's the headcount addition and the sales force, we're going to be funding that through the productivity work that -- that kristen described.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok great. that's very helpful, thank you. and then secondly, kristen, could you provide the magnitude of the ppe headwind to gross margin this quarter within that 30 basis point decline, and -- and just given what you're seeing so far here in december with the surge in ppe orders, did i hear you correctly say that a similar headwind in the second quarter or that is -- that still up in the air?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd say second quarter is likely to be higher. we didn't -- we're not seeing it yet in december, but based on what we think is going to happen with inventory moving out the door, we do see a larger ppe headwind for q2, probably also for q3. and then, i think, i heard you mention something in there on -- on q1. we did see some ppe mix headwind in q1 that was really driven by some large orders that went out the door, which is a similar reason that we would expect to see increased risk in the second and third quarters as well.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
so do you think your gross margin was closer to -- to flat with the positive pricing and purchasing that you had, if you were to back that out?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes, i'd say we were closer to flat.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok, thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, adam, maybe just to chime in a little bit with a couple -- two cents on -- on gross margin. and look, kristen hit this, i want to underscore a couple of points. i think what we're seeing since we -- you know, we basically said hey, for the year we see ourselves flat to down 50 basis points. since -- since last quarter -- two things, right? so one is we like what we're seeing on price execution and we like what we're seeing on the purchase cost side and the sourcing side.
i think that's a net positive. i think what we are saying, though, is we do see the potential in the next quarter or two for more pronounced ppe headwinds based on the factors that kristen described. you know, you've got a big mask inventory, virus surging, no secret prices have come down on masks, so there is the potential for a more pronounced ppe headwind for the next quarter or two than we've seen in the last quarter or two where there's been some that we've absorbed, but not as much as what we may face in the next quarter or two. i think for me, what -- what i'd want to underscore -- what i'm looking at is saying, hey, the ppe stuff, we're talking about a once in a generation kind of episode here that's really hard to predict.
it was really hard to predict months ago, it's really hard to predict now. for me, again, sights set on the three-year goals on the roic improvements. the real underlying value creation drivers for us are going to be price and cost. that's where we like what we're seeing.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
that's it, thank you.

the next question is from steve barger from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, good morning. just a couple of follow-ups. just -- first, for the impairment, you said the ability to get the gloves is increasingly in question. is that just based on how long it's been, or is there something more specific? and really, i'm trying to understand if we should be worried about inventory risk for other pandemic stuff as cases hopefully slow down as '21 progresses.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, steve. so look, this -- this is a -- this was a really unique situation with -- with nitrile gloves and we followed -- not only unique but a really difficult situation that is isolated to nitrile gloves in terms of a prepayment and an exposure of this size. you know, the -- the accounting rules are pretty clear than when you reach a certain point of uncertainty, and without going through all the details, you could imagine we're pursuing every path possible, but we reached a certain point of uncertainty, it was clear, we -- we -- we impaired the asset, which is a prepayment. what i'd say is we have used the prepayment tool many times over during this pandemic, and it's been -- it's become a fairly standard industry practice actually through the pandemic to secure scarce product.
it's worked out most of the time. this case to date hasn't worked out. what i would say, though, is in terms of prepayment exposure, if that's where you're going, no, we don't see another case like this. this is -- this is -- this is pretty unique.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so truly a one-off and you don't see inventory risk for other pandemic related products?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
we -- we -- certainly what i would see is we don't see any prepayment risk. i mean, you know look, obviously, as kristen described we're sitting on a lot of mask inventory. that will be a function of how it moves. is there risk there? sure, of course, depending upon how the virus moves.
but you know, what we're talking about, the set of facts with the nitrile gloves with the prepayment, isolated to that.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and of the 50 people added, did you break out how many were metalworking specialists versus the hunters, and how long does it take a new metalworking specialist to reach the level of productivity you want versus that new sales person?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so -- we did not. steve, for competitive sensitivity, we don't break out specifically. what i can tell you is we gave you the three sort of primary buckets of the 50 which are the bd hunters, metalworking, government as the three big areas of focus. what i -- what i would say with metalworking is we generally find a faster ramp-up because they are coming with industry expertise.
you know, the -- the one caveat. in most cases when we're hiring a metalworking specialist, they don't necessarily have their own book of business. what they're doing is they're supporting -- so the way we see the benefit in a metalworking specialist, number one, we're going to see it certainly in millmax installations, but we'll then see a lift in -- in -- in their geography for our metalworking salespeople who are out there generating sales because of the technical expertise the individual brings.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and presumably, that's a really fast ramp to get them up to speed on millmax to get them in the door, to hopefully leverage to other mro products?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
there is a ramp on -- there is a ramp on millmax, and we've been super aggressive about rolling it out. there is a little bit of a ramp on millmax. i mean, it's not rocket science, but certainly it's a new -- it's a new trick, it's a new technology, and that's the case not just for a new person but for all of our metalworking experts, so kristen mentioning pockets of investment, it's certainly been one area of investment where we've been rolling out sample kits and testing tools and doing training for our metalworking folks at a pretty fast rate. and that's -- that's a piece of our investment and we'll continue that.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and -- and just to be clear, that millmax program is unique to you?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes.steve bargerthat's great. thanks.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you.

our last question comes from patrick baumann from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my questions.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, baumann.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. just quickly, you talked about investments in sg&a of $15 million incrementally this year, and i forgot what you said annually beyond this year, but my question is on capex expectations and if you expect capex to go up over time as well as a result of the initiatives, and by how much?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes, so for this year capex, we're estimating in the range of $70 million to $80 million, which is a step up over our historical run rates. and then in the future years for the program, in '22 and '23, i'd expect we're -- we're seeing more of a sustained level over where we've been hysteric -- historically. probably not as high as the top end of that range but you're definitely going to see a sustained increase for the next three years.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
so that 70 to 80 is -- is going to be more of a sustained level, then, for those years? is that what you're saying?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
i'd say the lower end of the range, maybe think 60, 70 for '22 and '23, but you know, we're still working through a lot of the detailed planning on that. it's going to be dependent on how we prioritize different projects in the pipeline, what the specific investments are that we bring online at what time, but you know, we can give you some clearer guidance on that as we get closer to 22 -- 20 -- as we get closer to 2022.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and then -- and then on the longer-term kind of roic target, can you remind us of the components of that? like how much of that is sales versus margins? and i guess the invested capital side of the equation, are you assuming like, you know, changes in that by that time whether with working capital investment, or i guess maybe you're using debt and equity as the denominators for any buybacks -- i don't know. just trying to understand the components of that -- that high teens number.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes, so we -- we haven't broken that out specifically yet on what kind of the -- the drivers are or the components of getting to the high teens roic. i would say everything is on the table right now. we've been talking a lot, of course, about the growth and the operating expense side of things where we see gross margins going. but really, everything is on the table for us as far as opportunities go, and we did touch last call on turning our sights more aggressively to looking at working capital opportunities, and that's something that we'll be getting into throughout '21.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
just last one from me on -- on the -- remind me of the gross margin dynamics annually through that time, what you expect?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. so for the op margin framework for '21, you can think flat to down 50 bps is what -- is the guidance we've been giving. and then for the out years, we haven't commented specifically on what we expect to happen with margin, but we're seeing very strong price-cost and we're investing heavily into the pricing analytics. you're not sure what the inflation dynamics are going to look like that might be driving costs yet in '22 and '23, but you know, we'd be looking to cover that exposure and to continue to deliver strong realization.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
is there still a mix headwind though that you have to deal with over that time? i mean, that -- that's been kind of the story the last [inaudible].
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so there's -- there's always -- mix is the biggest unknown, right, and where we fall on those kinds of ranges on gross margin. right now, you're hearing us talk a lot about the ppe pressure, which as erik mentioned, that's really specific to '21. it's kind of a unique situation given the, you know, the pandemic dynamics.
but mix could remain a fluctuating factor for where we land in that range in '22 and '23, but i'd say it's more about where the growth comes from in terms of the products where we're growing, the parts of the business where we're growing, and then how fast each of those five growth levers comes online. that could definitely influence the margin rates.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, pat, just to maybe add a little perspective on gross margin, so if you -- if you think about our formula over time, you know, what -- what sort of what's going on as well. we've talked about, this year is a funky year with ppe and wild swings. ex-ppe, just ordinary course of business, you know, somewhere between 30 and 50 bps have been where we fluctuated in mix headwind, so the assumption we've had and what we've seen for a while is if price costs are flat, then you're looking at, you know, modest gross margin erosion year on year. that's sort of what the thinking has been.
what i would tell you is this year in particular, what you're hearing from me and kristen, is we may have outsized mix headwinds specifically because of ppe, but looking beyond that, you know, you're hearing us encouraged by our price realization and our execution there and the work happening on the sourcing side. and if those things continue and that momentum continues, it could create positive price -- price-cost spread which could eat into that mix headwind and create a little bit different dynamic for us, a better one. so obviously, to -- to be determined and we're early, but you know, on the price-cost front, we're encouraged by momentum.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yep, yep, sounds good. ok, thanks for the color. i really appreciate it, and best of luck guys.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you.

good morning, and welcome to the msc industrial supply 2021 first-quarter conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, jason, and good morning, everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me. as on our last call, we are all remote, so bear with us if we encounter any technical difficulties. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on the investor relations section of our website.
let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation. our comments on this call as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the impact of covid-19 on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition, expected future results, expected benefits from our investment and strategic plans and other initiatives and expected future growth and profitability. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.
information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors and the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec as well as in other sec filings. these risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid-19. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results which are non-gaap measures. please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation which contain the reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everybody. thanks for joining us. i'll begin by wishing each of you a happy, a healthy, and especially a safe new year. i'll start the call this morning with some perspective on our journey and our recent progress.
i'll then review first-quarter results and take a deeper dive into our growth initiatives. from there, kristen will review the financials in more detail and provide color on our structural cost program. i'll then wrap up before we open up the line for questions. as we enter the middle of fiscal 2021, momentum on our initiative is building.
this is evidenced in part by improving numbers. more importantly, by progress against our key initiatives and by the increasing pace with which we're operating the business. as a reminder, several years ago, we decided to reposition msc from a spot-buy a supplier to a mission-critical partner. we capture this in our new brand promise built to make you better.
and we did so in order to secure the next decade-plus of msc's success and to deepen the mode around our business. since that time, we have recreated msc's value proposition, remodeled our supply chain with an elevated presence on the plant floor, reshaped msc's sales force, built new platforms for growth such as ccsg, and we've accelerated the pace of innovation with advancements like msc millmax. we've built new digital capabilities like e-commerce to improve customer retention and loyalty and a new pricing function to improve price execution and realization. and finally, we've taken steps to create a more agile culture in order to drive change faster.
on our last call, we outlined mission critical or our pathway to translate these changes into improved performance. we share two three-year targets: and those were accelerated market share capture, and improving roic. we shared five growth levers that will deliver at least 400 basis points of outgrowth above ip by our fiscal 2023. we also shared a structural cost initiative that we yield at least 200 basis points in operating expense to sales ratio improvements by fiscal 2023 powering roic back into the high teens during that time.
while we're encouraged by progress, we have our sights set high and we're just getting started. we're making inroads on the five growth levers and we're moving aggressively on the structural cost front to achieve our one-year and three-year targets with a robust project pipeline and a steady drumbeat of changes being implemented across the company. looking outside of our company, all of this is happening against the backdrop that remains challenging but is showing some positive indicators. the good news on the vaccine front and the recently passed stimulus package will likely improve the outlook over the coming quarters.
i'll now turn to our fiscal first-quarter financial results which you can see on slide 4. overall sales were down 6.3%, and gross margin was down 30 basis points versus the prior-year period. our operating margin on a gaap basis was 7% and was significantly influenced by a nonrecurring asset impairment charge which i'll describe in greater detail shortly. as you can see on slide 5, excluding this impairment charge and adjustments related to severance and cost associated with mission critical, our adjusted operating margin was 11%, down 30 basis points from the prior year despite lower sales and supported by mission critical.
all of this resulted in earnings per share of $0.69 for the quarter, or $1.10 on an adjusted basis. we're seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels. most notably, our nonsafety and nonjanitorial product lines improved through the quarter and declined low double digits. tales of safety and janitorial products anchored by our ppe program continued growing at over 20% for the quarter.
the improving trends extended into december with total company sales growth estimated at 2.4%. while aided by some large ppe orders, december is nonetheless encouraging as the rest of the business excluding safety and janitorial was down in the low single digits year over year. looking at our performance by customer type, government sales continue to grow significantly year over year due to the surge in large safety and janitorial orders. national accounts declined in the low teens while our core customers declined low double digits, and ccsg was down mid-single digits.
as you can see on slide 6, industrial production remained in the negative single digits range but did improve over the prior quarter. most manufacturing end markets behaved consistent with this trend. although metalworking-centric end markets did continue to lag the broader ip index. more importantly, we have seen the gaap between ip in our growth rate begin to compress as expected.
we plan to build on that momentum and as a reminder, we target exiting fiscal 2021 with at least the 200-basis-point positive gaap above ip for our fourth quarter. i'll now turn to our growth initiatives. on the last call, i outlined five levers that will drive our improved growth over the next three years. and those are metalworking, solutions, selling our portfolio, digital, and diversified end markets.
today i'll discuss and focus on a couple of them. first, metalworking. we're investing heavily in our core business in order to widen our lead. one way we do so is by capturing new customers from local distributors who are under tremendous pressure in the current environment.
we track our funnel of opportunities and win rate by market, and both are progressing according to plan. we expect that price to progress to build as the locals come under more and more pressure with each passing month. msc millmax is aiding our efforts to capture market share. milling is one of the most significant cutting tool applications.
cutting tools represent roughly 30% to 40% of the $12 billion to $15 billion metalworking market. msc millmax not only provides opportunities to capture share within cutting tools but it opens up access to our customers broader mro purchases which are multiple times the size of their cutting tool spent. we're seeing strong early reception to the new technology. our funnel of opportunities is building quickly and is starting to produce new wins.
as we do with vending, we're offering msc millmax as a service in exchange for incremental share of wallet. the second initiative i'll feature is government, which is right now our largest diversification play. we've been working hard over the past two years to turn our government business from an underperformer to an outperformer. and while we're benefiting from a ppe tailwind, we are nonetheless pleased with our progress in the fiscal first quarter as the business grew over 35%.
beyond the current momentum, we're investing in this area to build for the future including adding hunter roles dedicated to creating new opportunities for us. third, i'll highlight our sales force build-out. growing and reshaping our sales force is an important enabler that powers each of the five initiatives. in recent years, we've taken sales headcount down in order to reshape the sales force consistent with our new strategy.
for the first time in several years, we're now poised to expand the sales force. we had a delay due to the pandemic but we've now restarted those efforts. in our fiscal first quarter, we increased our sales headcount by 50, including roles such as business development or hunting, metalworking specialists, and government. this effort has been aided by the redesign and outsourcing of our talent acquisition function which was one of the mission critical projects that kristen mentioned on the last call.
we are hiring faster and at a lower cost. before turning things over to kristen, i'll now discuss our ppe program and the related impairment charge for the nitrile gloves. from the outset of the pandemic, we have worked hard to source critical ppe supplies to support our customers in need and to keep the front lines of industry and government workers safe. despite the widespread scarcity of certain products and well-documented supply chain issues, we've been successful in this effort across a wide range of items.
nitrile gloves have proven to be more challenging. over the past several months, a number of our large customers approached us in dire need of the scarce product. our normal channels of supply could not produce sufficient quantities as the nitrile glove global supply chain is under extreme pressure right now. as a result, in september, our team turned to new sources of supply.
we used prepayments to secure priority status which has been a standard market practice through the pandemic and has been an effective tool for us in securing scarce products during this time. as of today, we've not yet received the gloves. and in light of the growing uncertainty over our ability to secure deliveries, we recorded an impairment charge for the full amount of the prepayments. we are of course pursuing all possible paths to either secure the gloves or a refund of our prepayments.
pulling back from this specific issue, we're quite pleased with our ppe program which has consisted of hundreds of global supply transactions leading to substantial revenues and most importantly the ability to keep our customers safe. i'll now pass it over to kristen.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. let me start with the review of our fiscal first quarter and then i'll update you on the progress of our mission critical initiatives. for reference on slide 4 of the presentation, you'll see key metrics for the first quarter on a reported basis. slide 5 reflects the adjusted results which will be my main focus this morning.
our first-quarter sales were $772 million, or $12.5 million on an average daily sales basis. both a decline of 6.3% versus the same quarter last year. moving to gross margins, our first-quarter gross margin was 41.9%, a decline of 30 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. sequentially, gross margin improved 30 basis points, compared to the fourth quarter 2020.
despite the headwind from some large ppe sales that we mentioned on our last call, we continue to see solid performance due to the traction of our initiatives. our execution on both the pricing and purchasing fronts has been strong with solid realization from our annual price increase as well as improvements to our supplier programs. december gross margins continued the trend of solid execution on the price and cost fronts. we could, however, see increased headwinds in gross margins due to ppe-related skus over the next couple of quarters.
total operating expenses in the first quarter were $243 million, or 31.4% of sales, versus $257 million, or 31.2% of sales in the prior year. this includes about $4 million of costs related to severance and the review of our operating model both related to mission critical. the severance made up about one-third of that amount. excluding these costs, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 30.9% in the prior year, excluding $2.6 million of costs related to severance.
operating expenses were also 30.9% of sales. we were able to keep the adjusted opex to sales ratio flat despite the decline in sales as our mission critical initiatives continued to deliver savings. i'll go into more details on the progress of our mission critical initiatives in a minute. including the asset impairment charge that erik mentioned earlier, all of this resulted in gaap operating margin of 7%, compared to 11% in the same period last year.
excluding the impairment charge, severance, and other related costs, our adjusted margin was 11%, versus an adjusted 11.3% in the prior year. gaap earnings per share were $0.69 adjusted for the impairment charge as well as severance and other related costs. adjusted earnings per share were $1.10. turning to the balance sheet and moving ahead to slide 7.
we achieve a free cash flow of $95 million in the first quarter, as compared to $72 million in the prior year. this improvement was driven by our accounts payable management and the deferral of payroll taxes under the cares act. as of the end of fiscal q1, we were carrying $521 million of inventory down $22 million from last quarter. roughly $60 million of that is related to ppe products and over half of that is specific to disposable masks.
this is ample supply should the virus surge continue. during the quarter, we continued to manage our liquidity very closely and we paid down $130 million of our revolving credit facility in q1. our total debt as of the end of the first quarter was $490 million, comprised primarily of $120 million balance on our revolving credit facility; $20 million of short-term,  fixed-rate borrowings; and $345 million of long-term, fixed-rate borrowings. cash and cash equivalents were $53 million resulting in net debt of $437 million at the end of the quarter.
since then in december, we paid a special dividend of approximately $195 million which we funded primarily from our revolver. the special dividend reflects our long-standing commitment to returning capital to our shareholders as part of our balanced capital allocation philosophy while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. before i turn it back to erik, let me provide an update on our mission critical productivity goals. on slide 8, you can see our original program goals of $90 million to $100 million of cost takeout through fiscal 2023 and as versus fiscal 2019.
on our last call, we shared that we had taken out $20 million of cost in fiscal 2020 and that our goal for fiscal '21 was to take out another $25 million to achieve cumulative savings of $45 million by the end of fiscal '21. i'm pleased to report that we achieved an additional $8 million of savings in the first quarter, bringing our cumulative savings to $28 million against our goal of $45 million by the end of this year. this is growth savings and does not reflect investments of roughly $2 million to $3 million in the first quarter, and $15 million expected in fiscal '21. while one quarter does not make a year, and we did capitalize on some low hanging fruit, i'm encouraged by our fast start to the year and our continued momentum in executing our mission critical productivity programs.
in addition to some of the initiatives i mentioned last quarter, which are proceeding as planned, we also have signed an agreement to sell our melville, new york facility. this 170,000-square-foot facility on 17 acres served as one of our co-headquarters. we will be relocating late this spring to a smaller 26,000-square-foot space nearby, which will accommodate our new hybrid working model. once the sale of our current location is complete, we will save roughly $3 million annually in operating expenses.
we will continue to review our real estate footprint for additional opportunities. and i'll now turn it back to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. last quarter, we outlined our mission critical initiative that aimed at turning the hard work we've performed over the past several years into improved financial performance. our company's sights are firmly set on two goals referenced on slide 12 to be achieved by the end of our fiscal '23: first, growing at least 400 basis points above ip, and second, returning roic back into the high teens. we have five growth initiatives powering our market share aspirations and we are executing significant structural cost reductions that we expect to improve operating expenses as a percentage of sales by at least 200 basis points.
as we move into the middle of our fiscal year, we're encouraged by the momentum that is building inside the company. this is evidenced by improving numbers and by improving the execution of the projects behind them. most significantly, there is an energy building inside the four walls of msc and with each passing quarter, we expect that energy to grow. we will not rest until we've achieved our mission of being the best industrial distributor in the world as measured by all four of our stakeholders.
thank you, and we'll now open up the line for questions.

thank you. we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from hamzah mazari from jefferies. please go ahead.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
good -- good morning. hope you're well. thank you for the question. i -- i guess the -- the first question, you know, you mentioned an outsized lift as -- as things rebound.
cou -- could you maybe touch on that a little more? is there -- is there this pent-up demand that you're hearing from your customers? i know you mentioned customers are building backlogs. you -- you hired 135 people, the most you've -- you've done in a long time. so clearly, you're confident on -- on what's to come. maybe just give us a sense of a, you know, level of confidence in -- in -- in the outsized lift, whether it's qualitative, it's fine, however you want to answer that question.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure, hamzah. thanks and hope you're well. look, i -- i -- i think what you're hearing from -- from me and kristen this morning is encouragement and excitement about the future of the business and the trajectory we were on and really feeling like we're -- we're -- we're at an inflection point here. we're coming off of a whole lot of repositioning work and we're moving into now execution on growth and cost takeout.
and i -- i think the confidence is coming really in terms of the outsized lift, hamzah, from two things: the macro and the micro. so the macro is what's happening in the environment. clearly, we're hearing from customers, as the vaccine rollout picks up steam, things are firming up, particularly starting to firm up in some of the metalworking markets that have lagged so much for the past year. you combine that with some infrastructure stimulus, and the macro looks pretty darn encouraging.
and then, you know, i'd say the same thing for what's happening inside of the company. you know, we've -- we've added cost takeout to an equation that we haven't had before, and that's allowing us to fund investment. while the 135 are not yet fully onboard, hamzah, that's going to build as they do. it is the largest increase we've had.
and yeah, we're -- we're encouraged by what we're seeing. and what i would say, it's qualitatively and quantitatively. so quantitatively, while look, by very early, we did start to see a positive spread to ip in our fiscal second quarter, which was a bit ahead of where we felt we'd be. and if you recall, at the start of the fiscal year, we were running under ip.
so that's just beginning. but really, that's just the start. and as these share winds and investments kick, we -- we see this building. so, you know, just to put a little more quantitative to it, as we look ahead right around the corner and you take out the ppe product lines in which there is going to be very high comps in our fiscal third quarter, look at nonsafety nonjanitorial business and we're seeing, you know, so in march, we saw that turned positive.
we would anticipate in q3 q4 healthy double-digit growth rates in nonsafety nonjanitorial business. so we do think it's starting to happen. and again, the nice thing is the investments we're making now haven't even kicked in yet in terms of realizing a benefit so that still to come.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got -- gotcha. and -- and just my follow-up question is -- is -- is just i guess two parts. one is on the safety piece, do you have a sense of what -- what is reoccurring versus nonrecurring for you post in the, you know, sort of in a post-vaccinated world? i know it's probably tough to know how many masks people will continue to wear post vaccine, but any -- any rough sense of that? and then secondly, you know, the -- the virtual hubs, could you talk a little more about that? like, you know, what i mean by that is can these virtual hubs replace your entire branch network or -- or where are you putting the virtual hubs, their sort of strategic locations? do they have any -- has any negative impact you see initially when you move toward a virtual hub and shut down a branch? just any more color around those would be great. thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. hamzah, absolutely. so the two questions, so let me start with the safety or ppe or, you know, it's really been safety and janitorial. what i would say is, look, still -- still early to say what will continue post pandemic here, which we hope is right around the corner.
what i will say is we're -- we're likely going to be negative and -- and -- and we saw it in march in our fiscal third quarter because that was when we had the huge surge last year. but if we look beyond our fiscal third quarter, look, the safety and janitorial businesses, even going back pre-pandemic, were growth businesses for us. we'd anticipate them continuing to be growth businesses. and, you know, a good case in point would be just look back at our q2 results.
so q2 was sort of still in the midst of -- hopefully, the tail end of the pandemic. no -- no crazy comps and the business was up double digits. i -- i think that would be, you know, our expectation of what could be fairly representative once we get past fiscal third quarter into sort of a more of a steady-state, that would be on -- on the safety ppe. the second question on -- on the virtual care hubs, we're excited about this one.
and -- and what i would say is this move, the seeds were planted on this move well before the pandemic and the seeds that were planted were really around technology, around a smart integrated phone system, and around the crm system that allows our entire sales team inside outside to get -- have a 360-degree view of the customer. so what we did, hamzah, is -- is actually, you know, most of the branch locations that we had are now closed. what -- so what's changed is the physical footprint and removal of some management layers. what hasn't changed is the one-to-one connection of our inside people with their customers.
so our -- our -- our same inside salespeople that have built sticky relationships with customers for years and years are still -- there just -- they're -- they're working from home. they're working remotely. but they're still the same ones speaking to customers every day and it's -- we -- we've -- we've been able through the technology to create a virtual local branch if you will. and what that does, again, is it not only take out costs that we can reinvest into growth but allows us to then open up hiring of technical talent wherever an individual may sit, even if it's not where one of our branch locations are.
so we are encouraged. we had a good plan going in. i think we moved through it quickly. early returns have been positive.
i think the other thing i'd add at the buzzer is, you know, realized our branch locations were not primarily inventory stocking locations. so our service in terms of inventory to the customer and delivery has also not changed. so on the -- on the risk front, very low. i do think -- look, realistically, probably a little bit of distraction as we move through things in january and early february, but we're through it and returns have been positive.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
wonderful. thanks so much.

the next question is from ryan merkel from william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, everyone. my first question is on gross margin. morning. i guess a two-parter on gross margin.
how should we think about gross margins sequentially in the fiscal 3q? and then given the price increases you've announced, can price cost be neutral in the second half of 2021?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hey, ryan, yes. so for sequential or kind of second-half perspective on gross margin, i'll start with q2 to q3. so we do expect margins to bounce back in the third quarter to the levels that they've been running at. so around 42%.
there should be a nice tailwind from the price increase. and as i touched on the prepared remarks, that went into place in march. and q3 to q4, just a caution that we do see a typical seasonal downtick in the fourth quarter. but if you put all this together and excluding the ppe writedown, we would expect our annual '21 gross margins to be at least flat with full-year '20.
and this wouldn't -- i guess just as a caution contemplate, any other major pricing moves related to the strength of the inflation cycle.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. ok.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
ryan, i think -- and -- and just -- just to piggyback, i think kristen nailed it for '21. the only add is, and i know you've been covering us for a while, i think, you know, one of the other things to the story as we look beyond even the back half of fiscal '21 and '22, it does seem like the makings are there for a pretty robust inflation cycle. and that, you know, generally, you know, the increase we took now, if that is the case, would just be the beginning of moves to come down the road in response to continued inflation. and again, early stages of that should be a tailwind for us.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
yeah, that actually leads to my second question which was about incremental margins looking out since that's a question i'm getting from clients. so, i don't know, maybe this is for kristen, but how should we think about incremental margins in '22 and '23? can we get to the old days of mid-20s and what level of top line would you need? and then, erik, you mentioned the price environment, that's also a consideration. so maybe how should we think about that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. let me take that one, ryan. and i guess i'll kind of walk you down how we're thinking about '22 and '23, just sort of thinking about the structure of the p&l and to kind of frame it up.
you heard erik talk a lot -- about a lot of these themes, but, you know, look, we're really excited about what's building here and i think erik used the term inflection point. i totally agree with that. it's a good descriptor. we -- we like what's happening inside the company, we like what's happening outside the company, you know, from a macro perspective as we touched on.
environment looks good, everything's kind of pointing to a strong recovery, and also the early stages have pretty healthy inflation cycle. and then inside, we've got this widening share gain over ip. so if you think then about kind of gross margins, generally, they've been stable despite the noise in ppe. and because we're moving into the inflationary environment, we -- we think we've got possibility for a pricing tailwind.
on the backside, we've been taking cost out pretty dramatically and -- and pretty differently than we've done here before at msc and we're well-positioned to leverage our fixed costs over the next few years. so, you know, we're not going to need another distribution center. we've been streamlining the headquarters footprint. we closed all the sales branches.
and, you know, as we've touched on that, we're reinvesting a good chunk of that back into growth. but kind of putting all the pieces together, it's a pretty compelling story on operating margin and we'd expect incremental margins to be 20% or higher starting in fiscal '22, you know, obviously, with the usual cautions about assuming the recovery holds and nothing kind of -- there's no set back from the virus which might derail things. but erik and i are pretty excited about what's been happening and very optimistic when we think about '22 and '23.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
very helpful. thanks.

the next question is from david manthey from baird. please go ahead.
dave manthey -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, dave.
dave manthey -- baird -- analyst
yeah, first off, relative to slide 9 where you showed the 2021 operating margin framework. when -- when i think about that and relative to the stronger pricing, higher gross and net opex cuts, and then some of the investments that should drive incremental stronger growth in a strengthening market, and i guess, overall, you kind of implied that flat revenues were the baseline for 2021. i'm just -- as i look at that -- the -- the grid there, shouldn't that put us squarely in the middle box with better odds toward the high side of the 11.2 to 11.6 based on a lot of those upside factors you just noted there?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, dave. i think the way you're thinking about that is right. i think we're -- we're -- we're definitely in that flat box with line of sight potentially to low -- the -- the top box of low single digit depending on how fast things pack -- pick back up.
dave manthey -- baird -- analyst
ok. and then kristen on -- on capex, i think when you originally outlined $70 million to $75 million for this year which you -- you just toned down, you implied that the higher rate would be carried forward. so, should we assume -- beyond this year, should we assume $70 million to $75 million in -- in the out year?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. for -- for '22 and '23, dave, we're still thinking about which investments come online at which times which is going to rebalance things between capex and p&l. potentially, p&l investment, potentially. but i'd say from a modeling -- from purposes of modeling, i would assume $65 million to $70 million in '22 and '23.
dave manthey -- baird -- analyst
and then finally as it relates to -- to capex and working capital and returns on invested capital, so you've -- you've outlined the higher capex. i don't recall you discussing anything about working capital changes. so, if -- if we just assume a roughly similar invested capital base, if you back into it you come up with sort of a low-teens operating margin would be needed to get you to the high-teens returns on invested capital. is that the way you're thinking about it over the next two to three years?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'd -- i say the most conservative case would be to assume similar levels of invested capital. we -- i think we touched on this briefly on one of our other calls, but we do see opportunities to make working capital improvements. it hasn't been our primary focus right now.
we're getting things kind of going with the p&l investments, the growth-related investments. but when you think about the whole like pipeline of projects that we have for mission critical, there are several things in there that are focused on working capital improvements like particularly around the value streams to procure-to-pay and order-to-cash that we haven't started actively working on in -- in a really big way yet but that is going to be a focus going into '22 and '23. and we'll provide you with more of the thinking on that once we get through '21.
dave manthey -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, tommy.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hey, tommy.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
hey, tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i wanted to double back to price cost and -- and really just focus on the cost inflation side. what kind of anecdotes or observations can you share with us there? maybe just comparing to last quarter trends better, worse, same? just any -- any insight you could provide there would be helpful. and then as we go forward, sounds like good, early results expected for the price increase you've just recently announced. but what's a reasonable timeframe for us to think about for when you might double back on whether you need to pull the pricing lever more just to -- to keep up with the cost inflation or potentially outpace?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, tommy. so, i'll -- i'll start with the first part of your question around -- around cost inflation and what we're seeing. look, i -- i think and it's probably not going to be a news flash but i will say that what's happening in the global supply chain right now, it's pretty chaotic. and i think that's really at the root cause of why -- why the change in the last few months.
but if you think about what's happening right now kind of across north america and global supply chain, we have a faster-than-expected economic rebound that's left a lot of our suppliers, manufacturers with insufficient inventory and capacity to handle the demand pickup. at the same time, you know, many of these businesses are still battling covid. they're still battering -- battling disruptions to the production line from covid. and so, that makes it even harder to ramp up production.
we're looking at extensive delays coming in, you know, for -- for things sourced globally, extensive delays at the ports. and then the -- the recent weather issues are recent. i'm going back to february now, but the weather issues in texas were also pretty significant in terms of messing things up. so, what's happening is there's a lot of product scarcity and that's beginning to lead to significant inflation.
and we're seeing it in the form of our suppliers beginning to move. in terms of -- and so, really that was in large part, the -- the driver behind our -- our march increase. you know, our typical cycle, tommy, would be the next sort of meaningful increase that we would take would be sometime over the summer. but what, you know, what i would say -- and -- and certainly, if things continue on their current trajectory with the macro, you know, we would anticipate a healthy increase because we are hearing more and more from suppliers about the need to make pricing moves.
what -- what i would say is, you know, if you look back over time, it's -- it's also -- it's feasible that we could even do something sooner. if we saw that much inflation heat up that quickly, we could move before that.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, erick. that's all very helpful. and -- and just to pivot to a bigger picture question here on -- on the millmax strategy. what -- what can you tell us about the pace of the rollout there? any anecdotes from the customer side? and for those of us observing from -- from outside the company, are -- are there any proof points you would call out to us that -- that we should be mindful of today and going forward? just to track --
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, tommy. so, yeah, it's -- it's -- it's a good point because we touched on -- we didn't touch on millmax in the prepared remarks. i did touch on sort of the output of that which is what's happening with -- with metalworking market share capture because they're closely coupled. millmax is really an enabler where -- so, what i would tell you is, you know, anecdotally, the technology is working really well.
and when i say working really well, the hit rate when we run a millmax test in terms of producing cost savings for customers is incredibly high. and it's still early. our team and customers are still adapting to the technology. very encouraging early going and it is fueling some of the metalworking capture.
what -- what i would say in terms of the best sort of output metric that you can latch on to, tommy, is going to be seeing what happens to our growth rate in the core -- in our core business. and particularly, if you look non-safety, non-janitorial because that's going to really -- it is going to be some noise for the next few months with comps. but as we break out, we should see real acceleration in that portion of the business that should be driven by a combination of millmax and metalworking market share capture. so, i -- i think that's what i'd look for.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. thanks, erik. we appreciate it and i'll turn it back.

the next question is from adam uhlman from cleveland research. please go ahead.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, adam.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hi.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
hey, adam.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
i was wondering if we could start with the -- the march price increase. could you remind us how big that price increase was? and then related to that, i -- i might have missed it but i -- i think, eric, you have mentioned that you would expect kind of a positive price-cost dynamic to unfold early in the cycle. but then, you know, we're seeing that gross margin is expected to be stable and then over the next couple of quarters. and so, would -- would there be anything that we're waiting on this next price increase to come through where you might be able to capture a little bit of a price costs spread? just maybe flush that out.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, adam, sure. so -- so, we -- look, we -- to be clear, we expect -- so, the -- the increase we took which -- which we took early in march as i mentioned -- sort of it was the first move that is response to inflation, roughly call it in the 2% range. what i tell you, still early, we're a few weeks in here, realization look solid. to be clear, we absolutely expect the tailwind from this price move.
so, i -- i think if you heard from kristen about stable for the balance of the fiscal year, you know, with sort of the formula that what she's capturing is pricing tailwind should absolutely help lift things. we -- we are mindful that we use -- our usual pattern is q4 drops from q3. so, we're sort of putting the two quarters together and saying, yeah, ok, roughly -- roughly about the same that you have a tailwind from pricing, a headwind from kind of the usual seasonal drop. if for whatever reason that seasonal drop were not to occur and you isolate it, yes, we -- we should get price tailwind from this increase.
and then yeah, that would -- that hopefully builds with more to come.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok. gotcha. and then as we think about the, you know, trends by your vertical end markets, i'm wondering if you could maybe walk through some of your bigger ones and -- and share where you're feeling, you know, the best about demand levels, you know, with -- within metalworking that's going to get us to this, you know, double-digit growth pace. we've got some easy comps, but, you know, just qualitatively, where are you feeling better about and -- and -- and what's still lagging? what -- what are the -- the verticals that you're kind of the most concerned about?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, adam. interestingly, so -- so, when we look at the verticals underneath sort of the broad ip index and compare our growth to -- to -- to ip, what's -- what's interesting is that, you know, we were encouraged by q2 where we saw the gap to ip flip to positive. and yet while that happened, our biggest end markets as you'd imagine are the -- are -- are large, concentrated metalworking end markets. so, machinery and equipment, aerospace, auto, etc.
those are still lagging the broader ip industrial production and for many of the reasons you can imagine. well, auto actually is not -- i should say auto is not, but of -- of our five big ones, i'm looking at them right now, four of the five other than auto, were lagging ip. aerospace being a -- a poster child for that. so, what's encouraging to us is we were able to outpace ip despite the fact that several of our big end markets were lagging.
as i look ahead and -- and certainly think about the vaccine rollout qualitative feedback from customers, it does seem like things are picking up steam even within those core metalworking end markets. so, that's part of what gives us encouragement along with what we're seeing in the market share capture, which, you know, we track at a detailed level that we're seeing from local distributors. so, you know, how that evidenced it -- itself in the numbers and your absolutely right, of course, it's on -- on lower comps, adam. but, you know, march, we saw -- so, if you think about how it builds.
and i'm taking safety and janitorial out again because of -- we're going to see peak comps in the third quarter. but march, non-safety, non-janitorial went positive mid-single digits. if we look out for the full quarter of q3 and into q4, we would expect non-safety non-janitorial to be healthy double digits. and, you know, look, that's -- that's even without some of the benefits of the growth drivers kick in.
overtime, that should build.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
great. thanks, erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, adam.

our next question comes from patrick baumann from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. i wanted to pick up on the last point. i mean, do you -- -- considering the recovery in the base business that you're seeing that, you know, you -- you can grow yourselves in the -- in the third quarter, or are those surge sales on -- on safety, you know, too much -- too much to overcome based on what you're seeing? i remember last year you talked about, you know, the first and i guess part of april being down, you know, and -- and -- and, you know, the end of march being down a lot. just curious what's the base business growing as you exited march in -- into early -- into early april.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. so -- so, patrick, if you're looking at total growth of company for q3, you know, i -- i would say -- it's not exactly sure to be honest. what i would tell you is the dynamics are non-safety, non-janitorial growing double digits, big ppe comp to overcome. we are, you know, right now, call it plus or minus flat on the total business.
and, you know, if things really accelerate, we could turn positive. but, you know, plus or minus flat q3 and then, you know, we get past may will be the big month with the biggest comp for -- for selling ppe. once you get past that and you go june, july, august, we turn a very healthy growth rate positive for the whole business.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. and then i'm just curious, the process that you went through to determine the -- was there a big charge in the inventory versus just waiting it through over several quarters? like what's -- what dictated that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. so in terms of taking the large charge at one time in the second quarter, without going into i guess the whole technical accounting overview, i mean, really what we were looking at is what we were seeing on market pricing for the disposable masks. and you know, based on how you have to account for inventory if we have a higher carrying cost on that product than what the market price is going for we have to take a writedown, which is what you saw happen in the second quarter. and i guess maybe to go a little bit further in terms of our decision to put that or to exclude that from the adjusted results.
our goal here is really to make sure we're giving you all max transparency about our numbers. and given the size of the writedown, it made it really difficult to see the results of the underlying business and kind of make heads or tails -- heads or tails of what's happening. and i guess for the more accounting -- accounting explanation on that, we were -- we -- we reviewed this pretty extensively and we view the inventory writedown charges as an unusual or infrequent event, and that was really what prompted our decision on how to reflect them in the results.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. and then the last one for me on -- on just the operating expenses, you know, kind of mid-$240-million range in the second quarter. it sounds like you could have a little bit of upside on -- on net savings in the back half versus your initial plan.
just curious how to think about that number into the back half -- the operating expenses. are there offsets? i mean, you mentioned growth investments, you know, maybe offsetting some offset and -- and some of the savings just kind of curious how to think about that number.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. so if we -- if we think like first half to second half sequentially, which is i think a better way to think about opex for the year, given all the noise we had in q3 and q4. last year was like covid cost-savings initiatives. but if you think about opex sequentially, you know, the first thing about variable expenses, you're going to see those increase because we're anticipating significantly higher sales levels between the first half and the second half.
and just as a reminder, you want to use a variable rate of about 10% of sales for our variable expenses. but one caution i'll give you is we're going to see that run higher in the second half as we're adding back incentive compensation expenses, and that's going to normalize after a quarter or two. and as you mentioned, we also highlighted that growth investments are stepping up the first half to the second half while the -- the cost savings -- the structural cost savings on mission critical the first half to the second half are going to be about the same. so if you put all that together, you're going to see the opex dollars step up in q3 and q4.
but the ratio as a percent of sales is going to decline relative to what we saw in the first half and -- and that's how we're thinking about operating expenses in terms of adjusted operating margin framework.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and remind me what -- what framework for -- for operating expenses?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
i'm sorry, say that one more time. i couldn't quite make that out.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
what--what was the total number that was in that framework for operating expenses for the year?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
we haven't specifically given an opex number. i think what you're going to see in the second half and why we're -- why we're pointing you guys back to operating margin framework is we've got moving pieces here in terms of what we see as risk or opportunity within the gross margin and within operating expense. so we've got a few different paths that might play out that put us within that adjusted operating margin framework, you know, which is really why you hear us point you guys back to that flat to a low single-digits scenario for op margin.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. yeah, i totally get it. it makes -- makes sense. thanks, i really appreciate the color.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer

our next question comes from chris dankert from longbow research. please go ahead.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
just returned to footprint realignment. definitely, there are some exciting changes this quarter. i guess, you know, how do we feel about customer engagement following these branch closures and just how we, you know, increased our activity, how do we avoid the call center feel? just -- just any comments on the customer interface after these changes.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. chris, good morning. so we -- we -- we are track -- first, i -- i think a couple of things, one is we're -- we're -- as you can imagine we're tracking customer feedback qualitatively, quantitatively very carefully and the early returns are strong. we're -- we're not seeing any -- any sort of blip.
i think to your point about -- you -- you -- what's your comment? how do we avoid kind of like a cult-like, a big company call center feel?
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
yeah. just -- just maintaining that -- that personal relationship.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
that -- that -- you -- you just hit the answer, chris. i mean, we really believe that, you know, sort of the answer to this business is digital and it's people together and it's about the one-to-one relationship. and i think, you know, some -- sometimes when moves like this can go awry it's when a company in management loses sight of the importance of the one-to-one relationship. in this case, these moves, we retain the one-to-one relationship.
so the physical goes -- the physical presence of the branch goes away. virtually our teams are connecting. they're on zoom or microsoft teams all the time with each other and they have the same customer relationships that they've always had. so that's the -- that's the biggest thing.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it, got it. and then, they've been kind of like a digital transformation there as well. the like link, you know, with the customers more -- more efficiently in terms of bidding and that type of thing or that's fairly much the same interface as well?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so what -- what i would say is that the digital transformation has been happening and is -- over time here, chris. and so, you know, the -- the ability to make a move like this happen because of technology that was put in place. it's going to continue to happen. so the -- the -- the enabler here was how we communicate with each other inside the company and how work gets done.
you know, we're beginning to make some inroads and investments.a few of the investments we're making are around the digital interface with customers as well and that's, you know, be -- beyond a website, but some -- some other elements so i would say it's going to continue. but certainly, it's been an enabler to make this happen.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. thanks -- thanks a lot for the color there. just one last quick one if i could. just any update on in-plant sales and kind of what signings looked like there.
i know that's still very, very early days, which is you know the implant details would be great.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, so -- so funnel and winds -- the winds are early. so -- so when we look at a funnel, we look at, you know, sort of total opportunity set and then we'll look at customers one and what the annualized revenue is. that will take a little time to build up but actually very encouraging.
so what we've seen and what i would say is beyond in-plant, chris. if we look at many of our growth drivers and another example would be vending or our inventory management solutions, we saw a low in both funnel and winds. you know that -- that basically coming out of covid because of the inability to get into customer plants, the inability to do presentations, that filled up in a hurry. so vending, for instance, our funnel is back to pre-covid levels.
and on in-plant, it's -- it's well beyond prefrontal -- pre-covid levels because it's a new program for us but it's building nicely. so we are actually on plan despite the pandemic this year with in-plant. we're encouraged.
chris dankert -- longbow research -- analyst
got it. good stuff. thanks so much.

our last question comes from michael mcginn from wells fargo. please go ahead.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. thanks for sneaking me in.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, mike.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hello.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i just want to go back and just verify some numbers. the $15 million to 18 million savings from the virtual customer hubs, what was that compared to what you had budgeted?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
what we budgeted for --
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
higher or lower.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
savings -- and that's -- that's the same range that we originally contemplated, the $15 million to 18 million.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then, the -- you're now expecting to exceed this year slightly higher than $25 million total cost-out savings. and it's saying -- it sounds like within your sg&a it's -- it's a lot of opex, but is there also a capex component? can you just walk us through the various items that it's -- what the cash cost to get there would be?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
so there are -- there are capex investments for mission critical, which i think is what you're -- what you're asking. is there -- there's a component if this is p&l and a component if that's capex, definitely. probably not as heavy on the capex side in '21 if we think about the order of projects coming online but there are things that would be in capex around our digital initiatives and around some of the solutions initiatives. but we haven't specifically carved that out in the term -- in terms of our total capex spend at this point.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. this last one is more of a high-level question, a lot of the quarterly questions -- earnings questions have been answered. but can you just walk us through -- you've done -- you have millmax, you've taken vending internal to improve your service, now the supply chain just globally is a little chaotic. can you just walk us through your service offerings as you are an integrated supplier, you know, helping customers manage new safety stock, and then maybe you know that level of tam increasing versus mill with the addition of millmax versus what you're hearing versus potentially 3d printing morphing from prototyping into the manufacturing kind of high throughput environment.
can you just high-level walk -- walk me through your tam as a full service provider.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, mike. i -- i think really what you're getting at is the heart of the repositioning that we did that we moved from spot by supplier, which basically meant the next day delivery the long tail inside of a customer which generally, you know, the long tail represents 20%, 30% of -- of total spend if that to becoming the mission critical partner. we're basically -- what -- what we're all about is helping our customers speed up their lead times, free up cash, and find productivity on the plant floor. so certainly it's opened up the total addressable market inside of a customer because we're attacking more elements of their spend and you see that like, you know, the acquisition of barnes which is now ccsg gave us a new avenue into maintenance.
millmax brings us closer and closer to the production floor that opens up production metalworking in a bigger way to us. so certainly, the addressable market we're looking at, you know, pretty much most things inside of the customer spend but all -- all of these services are really geared around saying how do we improve the customer's output and how do we make the business run better. you know, in -- in terms of -- there is whether it's 3d additive or advanced materials, there's a ton of things coming out our customers right now. and you know, they -- they -- they need help themselves making heads or tails of some of the advancements.
and i -- i think that's really what things like millmax are geared to do. our metalworking specialist has helped them navigate. so i'm not sure if that answer to your question. but you know, basically, the repositioning has opened up sort of the total spend to the cut from -- from the customer.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
i appreciate the time, thank you. that -- that answers my question.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the msc industrial supply 2021 second-quarter conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i'd now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, jason, and good morning to everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me today. most of us continue to work remotely at msc, so bear with us if we encounter technical difficulties. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments, as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on the investor relations section of our website.
let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation. our comments on this call, as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the impact of covid-19 on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition, expected future results, expected benefits from our investment and strategic plans and other initiatives, and expected future growth and profitability. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements.
information about these statements is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors and the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec, as well as in other sec filings. these risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid-19. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligations to update these statements, except as required by applicable law. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.
in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures. please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation, which contain the reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. good morning, everybody. i hope this call finds you doing well and staying safe and healthy. as we enter the second half of our fiscal year, i wanted to focus my opening remarks this morning on our company's mission.
since the inception of msc over 80 years ago and through our last 25 years as a public company, our mission has stayed the same: to be the best industrial distributor in the world as measured by our four stakeholders. and we've not wavered from this. two concepts underpin our pursuit of this mission. the first is reinvention.
we believe in the need to continuously reinvent ourselves in order to remain relevant and secure our future. our history demonstrates this, and it can be captured in chapters, each one of those chapters being defined by a different reinvention, from a storefront to a cataloger, from a regional metalworking distributor to a national broadline mro distributor, from catalog to digital, from direct marketing to field sales, from generalists to specialists. the second concept that underpins our mission is growth, which is the lifeblood of this company throughout its history. growth has enabled us to attract and retain great associates, better serve our customers, produce market share capture for our suppliers, and generate returns for our shareholders.
historically and up until the past few years, we produced a revenue cagr in the double digits with an organic revenue cagr in the high single digits. and these results were a product of continuous and focused investments. this growth produced strong incremental margins, which allowed for reinvestment back into the business, thus creating a virtuous cycle. our most recent reinvention has been one we've talked about: the repositioning of msc from spot-buy supplier to mission-critical partner on the plant floor.
like the other ones that came before it, this pivot was done to deepen the moat around our business and to secure our next phase of growth. this reinvention was complex. the moves took time, and they impacted growth while changes were made. we redesigned our value proposition, and we reshaped our sales force from one-size-fits-all to a more segmented one.
we reengineered our supply chain to move from the four walls of our distribution centers onto the customer's plant floor, and we sharpened our culture to move faster and more readily embrace change inside our business. while we did all of this, we reduced growth investments in areas like field sales in order to complete the reshaping into our new model. we are now emerging as a stronger company and are poised to reaccelerate growth. we've strengthened our value proposition with still more to come and further strengthened and extended our leadership in our core business of metalworking.
history shows that market leaders capture the largest portions of an industry's profit pool, and we will do so. five levers will fuel our growth, and we're investing into them in order to produce market share gains. market share capture will lead to growth, which leads to more reinvestment back into the business to further strengthen our core and to add more adjacencies over time. we've also focused on structural cost takeout, with a portion of the savings being reinvested back into growth even more aggressively.
we've captured both of these elements, growth and structural cost improvements, in the two mission-critical goals that we laid out at the start of the fiscal year. and as a reminder, those goals are reaching 400 basis points of market share capture by the end of fiscal 2023 and returning return on invested capital into the high teens by improving our operating expense-to-sales ratio, inclusive of a $90 million to $100 million gross cost takeout target. we're in the early innings of this journey, but the proof points so far are encouraging. you saw our commitment to these goals evidenced with the recent announcement regarding the move to virtual customer care hubs.
we are redeploying cost from back office, from management roles, and from rent and putting it into growth. we eliminated 110 positions, and we're adding 135 positions that are customer-facing and that will drive growth. this will represent the largest year-over-year increase in customer-facing sales role that we've seen in years. the recent announcement was also about talent.
by moving to a virtual customer care network, we retain our local one-to-one connection with our customers while knocking down geographic boundaries. we're now able to recruit technical talent wherever it resides. the improving economic outlook makes our story even more exciting. with the vaccine rollout picking up steam, we're seeing significant positive signs from our customers such as building backlogs and activity levels.
all indications suggest the continued firming of the environment. at the same time, the speed of the recovery coming on the back of significant economic disruption is leading to supply chain shortages and disruptions, and we are well-positioned to help address these for a couple of reasons. first, the local distributors who have been struggling for the past year and from whom we focused on market share capture will struggle even more during a snapback due to working capital constraints, limited product offerings, and limited delivery capabilities. the market share capture opportunity will only accelerate.
second, while we all face supply chain disruptions and shortages, msc's broad and deep product assortment, our multiple brand choices including exclusive brands, and our next-day delivery capabilities position us very well against the 70% of the market, made up of local and regional distributors. the speed of the recovery, commodity scarcity, and supply shortages are also leading to commodities inflation. we typically benefit in the early stages of an inflation cycle and should see a gross margin tailwind as we capture price earlier than realizing cost. as we look ahead to the latter part of 2021 -- or fiscal 2021 and into our fiscal 2022, assuming the economic recovery continues on its current pace, here's what we expect.
we anticipate improving average daily sales levels with strong growth rates in our non-safety and non-janitorial business. this will be fueled by the investments that we're making, and their contribution will grow over time. keep in mind that we'll see high ppe comparables in our fiscal third quarter, and this will mute our overall growth rate. however, this moderates by our fiscal fourth quarter, and we should see strong overall growth rates.
we anticipate a bounce-back in gross margin from the q2 anomaly, which i'll talk about in a bit. we should return to at least the levels at which gross margins have run over the past year with some potential upside due to the early stages of an inflation cycle. we also expect a continued stream of structural cost work that is moving us toward the higher end of our $90 million to $100 million cost takeout range. all of this should yield healthy growth that translates into expanding operating margins as we look ahead to fiscal 2022.
it's an exciting time for our company, and we remain heads down, focused on executing so that we can capitalize on the opportunity in front of us. i'll now turn to our second-quarter performance. before getting into the details, i'll start by addressing the obvious issue in our second quarter that impacted results, which is the inventory writedown on ppe of roughly $30 million. the writedown is exclusive to ppe inventory and is primarily comprised of disposable masks.
it's no secret that we moved aggressively in the early stages of the pandemic to acquire large quantities of ppe and, specifically, disposable masks. at the time, we were selling millions of masks per week, inclusive of some very large-quantity purchases for several of our large customers. some of these customers were not only buying large quantities at the time but also committing to even more large-quantity buys in the coming weeks and months. as a result, we bought big in order to ensure we could keep these customers safe and keep their operations up and running.
as time went on, these customers found that their consumption was not as great as anticipated. when that happened, we decided to play the long game. even in cases where agreements were in place, we decided not to impose them. we wanted to support our customers through the pandemic, knowing that what's really important is securing long-term loyal customers and keeping them safe.
as a result, we took on the extra inventory. pricing on these items has come down considerably. and at the same time, demand slowed even through the winter months when the virus surged. and so we were left with the exposure that we addressed in our fiscal second quarter.
this was an extremely unique set of circumstances. and if you look back, we've not had any meaningful inventory writedowns over the last decade. putting the ppe inventory aside, our fiscal second quarter reflected solid execution in a choppy but clearly improving environment. you can see our reported numbers on slide 4 and adjusted numbers on slide 5.
overall sales were down 1.5% for the quarter. we're seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels. and most notably, our nonsafety and nonjanitorial product lines improved throughout the quarter from low double-digit declines in our first quarter to mid-single-digit declines in our second quarter. sales of safety and janitorial products continued progressing nicely, growing in the low teens for the quarter.
looking at our performance by customer types. government sales continued to grow significantly year over year due to large safety and janitorial orders. national accounts improved sequentially and declined in the high single digits, while our core customers also improved sequentially and declined in the mid-single digits. ccsg finally improved to declines in the low single digits.
as you can see on slide 6, industrial production through the ipi or industrial production index continued improving, though it did remain negative through our fiscal second quarter. most manufacturing end markets behaved consistent with this trend, although metalworking-centric end markets did continue to lag the broader ip index. notably, the gap between ip and our growth rate flipped to positive. recall that a 200 basis point spread was our target for our fiscal fourth quarter.
so while it's still early, we are encouraged by our recent performance. march showed continued improvement. our nonsafety and nonjanitorial business turned positive growth for the month, as did ccsg, both of which grew in the mid-single digits. safety and janitorial, on the other hand, were down roughly 20% against last year's ppe surge.
we expect strong growth rates in our nonsafety and nonjanitorial product lines for the balance of the fiscal year. regarding gross margin. due to the ppe writedown, our gaap gross margin was 38.1%. but excluding that writedown, adjusted gross margin was 42%, down just 10 basis points versus the prior year and up 10 basis points sequentially from the first quarter.
looking ahead, we took our midyear price increase in early march in response to the early stages of the inflation cycle, which, again, are generally a nice tailwind for gross margins. so we expect the recent trending to continue into the back half of the year. in terms of our mission critical growth initiatives, we're particularly pleased with our metalworking market share capture from local and regional distributors. we track new customer market share wins by msa, or metropolitan statistical area, and have seen strong performance through this downturn.
we're just now scratching the surface in terms of the revenue contribution from these wins, primarily because metalworking customer spend has been suppressed to now due to the soft conditions. as things rebound, we should see an outside lift -- an outsized lift, excuse me. i'll now turn things over to kristen to cover the financials and overall progress on our mission critical program.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. i'll begin with a review of our fiscal second quarter and then update you on the progress of mission critical initiatives. on slide 4 of the presentation, you can see key metrics for the fiscal second quarter on a reported basis. slide 5 reflects the adjusted results.
our second-quarter sales were $774 million, or $12.7 million, on an average daily sales basis, both a decline of 1.5% versus the same quarter last year. moving to gross margins. our second-quarter gross margin was 38.1%, a decline of 400 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. as erik mentioned, this was primarily the direct result of the roughly $30 million ppe writedown we recorded during the quarter, which was primarily related to masks.
excluding this writedown, our second-quarter gross margin was 42%, a 10 basis point decline from the prior year and a 10 basis point increase sequentially from our first quarter. our pricing realization has remained strong, and solid execution of our supplier programs has continued. i'll add two points here. one, we don't expect any further impairments going forward.
and two, our midyear price increase had no impact on our fiscal second quarter as we implemented it in march, the first month of our fiscal third quarter. operating expenses in the second quarter were $245.1 million, or 31.7% of sales, versus $251.4 million, or 32% of sales in the prior year. this includes about $700,000 of legal costs associated with the nitrile glove prepayments we impaired in the first quarter. excluding these costs, operating expenses as a percent of sales was 31.6%, a 40 basis point improvement from the prior year in which there were no operating expense adjustments.
with regard to the nitrile glove impairment we announced in our fiscal first quarter, we're pleased to report that an arrest for suspicion of fraud has been made, and we've been notified that bank accounts holding a substantial portion of the impaired value have been frozen. the legal process is going to take some time to resolve this matter, and we will provide you with updates as developments occur. moving back to our fiscal second-quarter results. we incurred approximately $21.6 million of restructuring costs, primarily related to the move to virtual customer care hubs and a review of our operating model, both related to mission critical.
execution of our mission critical initiatives continue to deliver savings, and i'll go into more detail on that in a minute. in q2 of last year, we incurred $1.9 million of restructuring charges, and that was primarily related to consulting costs. all of that led to operating margin on a gaap basis of 3.6%, but that was significantly influenced by the ppe writedown and the restructuring charges related to the virtual customer care hubs. excluding this writedown, as well as the restructuring and other related costs, our adjusted operating margin was 10.4%, up 30 basis points from the prior year due to our progress on mission critical and despite lower sales.
gaap earnings per share were $0.32. adjusted for the inventory writedown, as well as restructuring, and other charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.03. turning to the balance sheet and moving ahead to slide 7. our free cash flow was $4 million for the second quarter as compared to $58 million in the prior year.
the largest contributor was our increasing inventory and accounts receivable balance as our sales picked up in january and in february. as of the end of fiscal q2, we were carrying $533 million of inventory, up $12 million from last quarter. this is net of the $30 million inventory writedown during the quarter. we're actively managing inventory levels to ensure we can support our customers as sales accelerate in the second half.
therefore, inventory will likely continue to be a use of cash. we now expect capex for the fiscal year of approximately $50 million to $60 million. we still expect our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income to be above 100% for fiscal '21. as we mentioned on our last call, we increased our debt to fund the $195 million special dividend paid in december.
our total debt as of the end of the second quarter was $684 million, comprised primarily of a $115 million balance on our revolving credit facility, about $200 million on our uncommitted facilities, $20 million of short-term fixed rate borrowings, and $345 million of long-term fixed rate borrowings. cash and cash equivalents were $20 million, resulting in net debt of $664 million at the end of the quarter. let me pivot now and provide you on an update on our mission critical productivity goals. on slide 8, you can see our original program goals of $90 million to $100 million of cost takeout through fiscal '23, and that's versus fiscal '19.
on our last call, we shared that we had taken out $8 million of gross savings and invested roughly $2 million to $3 million in the first quarter. during our fiscal second quarter, we achieved additional gross savings of $9 million, bringing our cumulative savings for fiscal '21 to $17 million against our goal of $25 million by the end of this year. we also invested roughly $5 million in q2, bringing our total investments to $7 million to $8 million, which compares to our full-year target of $15 million. we're ahead of plan on savings, and our investment program is also progressing very well.
in fact, these results are such that we anticipate making some additional growth investments to capture more of the opportunities that we're seeing. on balance, this means that our net savings target for mission critical remains roughly the same or slightly larger for the full year. the most significant initiative during the quarter was, of course, our move to virtual customer care hubs, including the closure of 73 sales branches. the gross savings related to that move are expected to be between $7 million and $9 million in fiscal 2021 and reach an annualized level of approximately $15 million to $18 million starting in fiscal 2022.
before i turn it back over to erik, let me walk you through some of our expectations for the back half of fiscal '21. with respect to revenue growth, as erik described, we expect to turn nicely positive in our nonsafety and nonjanitorial business this quarter, and assuming these trends continue, should see healthy growth rates for the total business in the fiscal fourth quarter. for the year, while still early, it is likely that we will be flat to positive for total company growth. we expect our gross margins to remain at levels where they've been running, excluding the writedown.
in terms of adjusted operating expenses, you can expect to see a step-up sequentially from volume-based expenses, increased incentive compensation, and increased growth investment. after taking all this into account, we remain on track with our adjusted annual operating margin framework for fiscal 2021, which you can see on slide 9 of our presentation. where we fall within that framework will primarily be a function of how quickly revenues accelerate and how much gross margin tailwind we see from price. and i'll turn it back to erik now.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. as we move to the back half of fiscal 2021, momentum is building both inside and outside of the company. on the outside, the environment continues to firm. on the inside, we're accelerating progress with respect to growth investments and structural cost takeout.
i'd like to thank our entire team for their commitment to our mission during the past year. and while we're just getting started, we are encouraged by the progress that is beginning to evidence itself, and we'll now open up the lines for questions. and while we're ju -- we're just getting started, we are encouraged by the progress that is beginning to evidence itself. and we'll now open up the lines for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question today comes from tommy moll from stephens. please go ahead with your question.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hey, tommy.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, tommy. how are you?
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
doing great. doing great. erik, i wrote down one of your comments, and i think i'm getting this about right. you talked about this being one of the most robust pricing environment you've seen in years.
so i wanted to dig in on that. talked about another increase in june. possible we'll see another one before the end of your fiscal year. any way you could frame for us what the june increase looks like quantitatively? and if you play this out longer term beyond the next quarter or two in this kind of inflationary environment, is this a net benefit, net neutral to your platform? how does it play out?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
tommy, so, yes, look, i think -- let me start with the macro and the environment and you did capture the -- my comments accurately. if you go back -- and for those who have been studying our space for long periods of time, you go back to different eras that we've experienced for the past 10 or 15 years. and generally strong, robust inflation is a distributor's friend. and so if you looked at msc's gross margin performance in the 2000s versus what it's been the last several years, you'd see a noticeable difference.
and we've talked about our gross margin formula consisting of three things: price, cost, and mix. and we've talked about the fact that there's generally a mix headwind in the business of somewhere 30 to 50 basis points. so to the extent pricing costs were awash, we would see erosion of somewhere 30 to 50 basis points. and not surprisingly, over the past few years, that's about what you've seen from us in a very low inflation environment, i think, unusually low.
2000s may have been unusually strong. this is unusually low. certainly, some of the supply chain issues that we've -- we discussed in scarcity are leading to more inflation than we -- than i've seen in at least a decade. price increases coming from suppliers fast and furious.
you're right. for us to take two moves in a matter of a few months, we haven't done that in a while, and that's in response to the environment. net-net, tommy, we view this as a positive. typically, what you would see from us is the early stages of an inflation cycle.
price would outpace cost. and we believe that's where we're at right now. certainly, in the later stages, things can flip around. but to the extent that this inflationary cycle has some legs to it as it appears, we would expect price to outpace cost.
so if you look -- the proof in the pudding will obviously be in our numbers. but you think about, yes, we're going to begin to start seeing cost in our p&l. yes. that'll begin to happen as early as this quarter.
but you sort of zoom out and say, ok, fiscal 2021, we're calling to be plus or minus flat with prior year. and as best we can tell now -- and, of course, we'll come back next quarter with a framework as we normally do. but as best we can tell now, we're giving you sort of a look ahead to '22 and saying, we're seeing a roughly flat picture that would imply positive price cost in each of those years to offset mix. and then you take it a step further and i'll stop talking, tommy, but if this business can produce roughly flat gross margins and ip does what it is forecast to do and we continue to build on our internal momentum and outpace ip, you're looking at strong top-line growth, roughly flat gross margins, enhance that with some cost takeout, and we think we have a really compelling picture.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you, erik. that's all very helpful. i wanted to follow up with a question on inventory, which you provided some helpful comments on in the script. what -- has the philosophy changed at all in the appropriate level there? i mean, you've got potential supply chain issues that you may want to protect against.
i think you referenced in the script the opportunity to deploy or to put your balance sheet to work with some inventory to take market share. has anything changed in your mind about how to manage that, or what do you want us to know about how you're thinking about inventory right now? thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
tommy, i would say this. no change in philosophy, some change in tools and tactics, and keeping up with the times. but in terms of philosophy, no change. and, again, going back, being in this business now over two decades, times of growth and times of product scarcity create really compelling opportunities for distributors like msc.
bottom line is if you have stuff on the shelf, you're going to capture share. so i think what you're seeing, the big build in inventory you're seeing over the past quarter, and we telegraph, we expect it to continue, we would have liked it to be even bigger if it weren't for scarcity issues. we're going all in on making sure that we have product on the shelves for our customers at a time when product is scarce, and it's critical as the economy now ramps back up, the industrial economy that our customers keep their lines running. so we are going all in on inventory, and it sort of is a reflection of our view on the outlook of the economy and a view on the importance of having product to capture share.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, erik. i'll turn it back.

our next question comes from hamzah mazari from jefferies. please go ahead with your question.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. this is actually ryan gunning on filling in for hamzah. could you just talk about your current vending initiative and how much of your customer base or what percent of revenue is vending and what kind of growth you're seeing there?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. sure. good morning, ryan. and what i'll do is just connect back to, if you recall, we are right now laser focused on restoring the kind of market share capture rates that this business had become accustomed to.
and so we put our first marker out there, 400-plus basis points by '23. the first sort of goalpost in getting there is going to be our fiscal fourth quarter, at least 200 basis points. and then if you recall, we outlined five growth initiatives that are going to get us there. one of those is what we refer to as solutions.
and in solutions, it's -- specifically it's three things. it's vending, it's vendor-managed inventory, and it's our in-plant program, all of which are aimed at bringing us closer to the customer and embedding us onto the plant floor. so what i would say is vending is picking up steam. we definitely saw -- not surprisingly, ryan, we saw a lull in our new account signings.
the growth rate, of course -- the growth rate of the installed base came down with covid and has bounced back as the business has. the new signings took a lull during the pandemic because of the inability to get into plants. we are seeing it come storming back. so we're measuring size of funnel, dollars in funnel, close rate.
all of those are doing what we wanted to see happen. as the years gone on, they've gotten stronger and stronger. so what i would say is remains an important growth driver along with bmi and in-plant as part of this solutions initiative.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you. and then i guess kind of switching gears.
can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of metalworking markets from a growth perspective and just the competitive dynamics there?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. so i think from a market standpoint, what we're seeing is -- and particularly, ryan, this quarter, if you think about metalworking and our end market exposure, they're very tightly coupled. and so not surprisingly, nearly half of our sales are tied into five heavy manufacturing end markets that are the bulk of where the metalworking consumption happens. those heavy manufacturing end markets went down deeper than most of the economy and quite frankly have been a little slower to recover.
we saw that start to flip in the past quarter. and so if you take a look at below the ip reading, you can see some of the sub indices. we are starting to see the heavy manufacturing markets come back, and we think that's a great opportunity for us in terms of share capture. we're still sitting -- so leadership in metalworking, but still sitting in the neighborhood of 10% market share.
so we've got a big runway ahead of us in terms of share capture, and we have end markets that we think have legs to them in terms of this recovery. so we're excited by our metalworking outlook. and what i would say is, to capture that share, there's a few things that are powering it: investment into people. so you see our head count taking up.
that's investment into metalworking talent. we did it both organically in the past quarter through acquisition. we're really excited about hurst joining the family. we're doing it through technology with initiatives like msc millmax that are combined with our people are really helping customers take cost out of their operations.
and then i mentioned earlier to tommy's question sort of the old-fashioned way of just having product on the shelf when others don't. we think that really matters as well. so all of those sort of feed into what we think is an exciting metalworking outlook.
ryan gunning -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's all super helpful. thank you very much.

our next question comes from adam uhlman from cleveland research. please go ahead with your question.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, adam.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
hey, adam.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
hey. can we go back to the price increase discussion we were having earlier? i guess, in the operational stats, it looks like there was $1 million attributed to price, which seems kind of low, and i understand there's some other offsets that you call out in there like customer mix and product mix and discounting. can you maybe parse that apart between what were the headwinds that offset the price increase from march? and then as we put this price increase through in june, how should we be tracking that contribution to total sales growth? i guess, maybe you could just mention it too. it sounds like low single digits, but maybe you could clarify that.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. so going back to the first part of your question, the first thing i'd say is price realization, i think, as erik touched on, is solid. we're pleased with what we're seeing around realization. and then the second metric that you mentioned, which is what we see in the growth decomposition -- composition of the op stats, that has about 0.1% of growth assigned to both price and mix.
so to your point, it's a combination of things that are in that metric. normally, that's a pretty good indicator for how you could think about price growth in the business. but what's happening in the second half of this year in q3 and q4 is if you look at the large amount of ppe volume that we had in the base, so in the second half of '20, it's really making it not a very meaningful metric to think about how price is impacting the business. so that's kind of what you see near term.
i think if you zoom out and you look at what's happening, sequentially, we did grow margins from q2 to q3. so that's an indicator that we're seeing, the price benefits that we had expected to see coming into the numbers. and then beyond that, like erik touched on, we're seeing about flat margins, 20 to 21, which is not something we typically see in the business. that means we're offsetting the cost coming down to the p&l and that traditional mix headwind that we see in the business, and we're expecting to do the same thing again in 2022.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok. gotcha. thanks. that's helpful.
and then for mission critical, i guess, there's $40 million of gross savings remaining over the program for the next couple of years. could you dimension some of the bigger buckets that you expect those savings to come from? and then have you changed your thoughts at all on your reinvestment appetite of those savings?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so for the few -- for the following two years on the program, '22 and '23, we've got programs that are working across all areas of the p&l. i think we're -- you think about kind of the transformational work that we have ahead of us sort of like the bigger, longer-term projects to execute, you'll probably see us pivoting a little bit more to the operations side of the business. we did a lot of work around the sales side of the business that you saw us execute in '21.
so there'll be a bias toward operations on the transformational work, but then the pipeline of projects really touches every part of the p&l. there's a lot of small things that are going to deliver benefits, particularly in kind of '22, second half of '22. we'll got carryover in the beginning of '22 from what happened with -- in particular, the sales program or the sales restructuring that you saw us execute in fiscal '21 and then those transformational projects are going to kind of position us for '23 and beyond. and in terms of the reinvestment, i'll give you guys some firmer guidance on that next quarter when we publish the framework.
but one of the things that we're looking at right now is kind of which projects we want to bring online and when on the growth side, and we're really committed to delivering that incremental margin of greater than 20%. so we'll probably adjust the investment schedule accordingly based on our other assumptions to make sure we're delivering on that incremental north of 20 that we committed to for fiscal '22 and '23.

our next question comes from david manthey from baird. please go ahead with your question.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, dave.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
first off, kristen, in your discussion there on price mix. if we set mix aside, it sounds like you had solid price realization on the march increase. and with the glide path from that increase in addition to the new june increase, in light of the current inflationary environment, should we be reading that your expectation for price realization alone might be on the higher end of low single digits or even in the mid-single digits in the coming quarter?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
no. i'd say lower single digits is a reasonable expectation, dave. and i think what's starting to happen too in q4 is the cost -- or all the inflation we're seeing passed on to us from suppliers are starting to roll onto the p&l. so it's dampening a little bit of the price cost spread we might have been hoping to see when we looked forward last quarter.
but generally still really pleased of being able to offset the mix, cover the cost, and keep the margins flat for the full year.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. and i know you've always been hesitant to talk about price realization specifically, but if -- based on your comments, it sounds like from your price realization, forgetting about mix and forgetting about the cost side, it sounds like you're seeing good realization, which might imply a little bit higher than low single digits. is that in the ballpark?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
we are seeing our realization come online as expected. yes.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. fair enough.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. and, dave, just to put color on that. as kristen mentioned, so the metric that's the public metric she mentioned because of last year, the ppe surge, the mix component of that metric is so distorted compared to what it typically is a normal time. that will correct itself in a quarter or two.
as you could imagine, inside the company our pricing team has 10 ways 'til sunday in which they're looking at more micro price realization metrics. and, yes, we're seeing just as kristen said, just as we would have expected in terms of the outcomes.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. sounds good. and second, on the e-commerce front, it seems like that metric lost momentum during the pandemic and has since reaccelerated. i think, trailing 12 months, you're back over 60% e-commerce.
what does that tell us about the trends in the business, if anything, as we come out of the downturn here?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, dave. so i think important to understand just sort of what makes up sort of the buckets under that 60% e-commerce. obviously, there's a big chunk. over half of that is mscdirect.com.
and that's the part right now, i mentioned investments into digital. most of the investments are directed there to take mscdirect.com to another level. and certainly, i would expect over time that portion of the business to grow as a percentage of revenues. the total 60% includes other buckets like vending, things flowing through a vending machine; e-procurement with large accounts, which -- so there was sort of a lot of mix dynamics going on underneath the covers.
because as you can imagine, i mentioned earlier, vending dropped considerably during the pandemic and is now climbing back. for us, what i'm going to be looking at is the quality of the experience on mscdirect.com, going to be looking at retention, average order size and some sort of the micro measures. and then yes, i think for you, over time, seeing a 60% grow will be the way to look at it and evaluate it.
david manthey -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. thanks, erik.

our next question comes from ryan merkel from william blair. please go ahead with your question.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, everyone. nice job on gross margins this quarter.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, ryan.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, ryan. thank you.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
so my first question is on sg&a leverage. i know you expect strong leverage in '22, but should we expect sg&a leverage in the fiscal fourth quarter?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so fiscal fourth quarter is going to -- we're going to come down sequentially, ryan, relative to where we were in q3, a little bit of that coming with a decline in sales. and then we're also going to see a bit of a normalization on the sales incentive compensation. so we will see a more favorable opex rates coming in q4, better leverage coming in q4, and then for the year, feeling confident that we'll land inside that low single-digit framework.
i'd say, probably on the lower end of that, given where we think revenue is going to land and kind of given what we see happen in the inflationary environment, really, we've talked a lot about kind of what's happening on the cost of goods sold with inflation, but we're also seeing some costs start to creep into the business on the sg&a side around things like labor inflation, wage increases, things like that.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
all right. so it sounds like sg&a leverage will improve in 4q, and then it will improve more so in 2022. is that right?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
correct.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
ok. and then my second question, june average daily sales growth, that was a nice number. i know you're not giving guidance, but i'm hopeful to get your view on what inning of the macro recovery we're in and then if sales growth can accelerate from the june level.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so, ryan, i -- look, i think from our perspective, we are encouraged. i think for me, june as sort of one data point, we're looking at sort of at a bigger story here. and i am encouraged by the momentum we're seeing. and i think that goes for macro, but also sort of from micro, meaning how is the company doing relative to ip.
we had a pretty good quarter in q2. obviously, ppe noise here, but we are starting to see progress. in terms of the macro recovery, again, ryan, we're coming from a fairly slanted view where we're heavily exposed to heavy manufacturing, which have been hit hard at a later stage. so we think there's plenty of room here.
we're kind of hitting a speed bump as an economy, an industrial economy, with the supply chain and labor constraints right now. no question impacting growth with our customers anyway. but we think there is a nice recovery here, particularly in certain end markets where we think there's a ways to go. to answer your question early innings.
and then i feel the same about internally. we still feel like we're in the early innings. we think this year has kind of been a proof point that we're on the right track, but we have sights set high in terms of share capture and spread above ip and still feel like we're early innings there, too.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
sounds good, erik. thanks.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.

our next question comes from michael mcginn from wells fargo. please go ahead with your question.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hey, everyone. good quarter. i was hoping to get a little more color -- hi. i was hoping to get a little more color on the recent acquisition.
is there -- can you frame for us what aerospace is like roundabout percentage of your business today? is there ever a point from a portfolio management standpoint where you think you cap yourself?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
mike, so we're sitting at around -- so i'll touch on what hurst brings to us. so aerospace, roughly a 10% of msc's revenues. we think that it is a really good fit in terms of an end market for msc for a number of reasons. first and foremost of which we can really move the needle for our customers' productivity using metalworking.
our metalworking experts, metalworking technology like millmax, our product portfolio, etc. so we think it's a good fit. in terms of capping it at some point, that will be a very high-class problem. we think we have a ways to grow and penetrate in that market.
we really like the timing of hurst because aerospace obviously has been on its back and we think has a long way to go in recovery. and what really excites us is the team there is really technical and really focused. so they're bringing something, in some sense, expanding our metalworking capabilities for sure, but they're really bringing something that we don't have organically in the business, which is a metalworking focus specific to aerospace. and we think that's a capability, not just to build out and cross-selling to their customer base, but for john and his team, we think we can leverage that team across msc's broader aerospace customers to increase penetration.
so we see -- bottom line is we see a ways to go with aerospace. and at some point, we'll be in a high-class position to have to try to cap it, but we got a long runway in front of us there.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and then going back to the earnings algorithm you outlaid earlier in the call, mentioning if we can get flat gross margins. just in terms of that, how back to -- how much runway do we have to get back to normal in terms of gross margin rebates and in terms of the local core customer catching up to that national account?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so here's what i'd say, mike. so let me break apart gross margin into three buckets: price, cost, and mix. what i would say is we still see -- so over the past few years, price and costs have more or less been awash. and what you're hearing is that price is now outpacing cost.
and we think that as long as the inflation cycle continues and by all measures, given product scarcity, labor scarcity, etc., etc., it does feel like we're in the early stages of an inflation cycle. to the extent that continues, while costs are going to creep into the p&l, we think we can stay ahead of it with price. that brings us to mix. mix has a lot of -- you mentioned a couple of moving parts, mike.
there's a lot of moving parts to mix in terms of which product lines are growing faster, which end markets are growing faster, size of customers, you said, national accounts, etc., net-net, when you put it in the wash and you put all of the mix components in the wash, we still see a negative sort of a headwind coming from mix, and we do still see it somewhere in the 30 to 50. and it's tough to give you a precise number, it moves around, but somewhere 30 to 50 bps per year. so the way we get to sort of an out -- the way we get to flat and take '21, as -- for instance, is some mixed headwind, yes, but price outpacing cost and loans being awash.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. appreciate the time. thank you.

our next question comes from kevin marek from deutsche bank. please go ahead with your question.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
a lot has been asked. i guess, maybe wondering if you could give some more color on some of the supply chain constraints. what are you seeing in terms of labor, product availability? and have things gotten better or worse for you and for your customers and kind of how are you managing that?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, kevin. so let me talk about -- i'll talk about sort of broad marketplace, which would include customer and supplier. i would say over the past quarter, the supply chain issues have become more acute, not less. and i think that, in particular, the one that is just white hot is access to labor.
everybody i'm talking to is feeling the pinch. and what that means is it's really, at this point, constraining growth. i think the exciting thing is, to the extent this is a speed bump, the long-term prognosis outlook is really good. but what it means for our suppliers and inability to hire people who are needed to produce stuff and ship stuff to distributors like msc for our customers, it's much the same.
their order backlogs are massive and they can't keep up and they can't get product out the door. i think from our standpoint, kevin, we think we're really well-positioned to navigate this. first of all, it should be temporary. i mean, who knows how long it takes to relieve, but it should be temporary.
the second thing is we think we're well-positioned. number one is that whatever issues we're facing -- and we are facing them and we mentioned we would like inventory levels to be even higher than they are. we're facing issues from our suppliers. but whatever we're facing, remember, 70% of our market is made up of local distributors who really struggle in gaining access to product.
so we think there's a tremendous market share capture opportunity. and then the second thing i'd say is that all of these constraints and scarcities are what is fueling the inflation that is then fueling the ability to take price. so we think we're well-positioned to navigate this. we think the outlook is really good.
but to be clear, absolutely, the issues are acute and labor is at the top.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. maybe just one more, getting back to kind of the mission critical commentary. is there scope to -- by the time we get through fiscal '23 to be above 90 to 100 million, given that you're executing on a chunk of it kind of faster than originally anticipated.
i'm wondering if there are other things or other initiatives that maybe didn't make the first round of planning for mission critical that you now feel like you may have the ability to pursue.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes, i think we're definitely optimistic that that's possible. we're clearly at the higher end of that 90 to 100 million range right now. and one of the things we've talked a lot about internally is that we communicate mission critical as kind of time sense between '19 and 2023. but really what we're doing here is changing the culture of the company to make this idea of driving these costs out of the business and ongoing -- an ongoing part of what msc does year after year.
so we do have a long pipeline of projects. i think it's always possible we shuffle timing on some things, pull some things forward that could provide the potential to go above that. but one of the things we are thinking through for '22 is you've got some big projects to execute in '21, the carryover, the smaller new things we're going to execute to help us in '22, and then you're going to see us really reload and kind of recharge on the transformational projects that'll hit in '23 and beyond. so to the extent that we could bring those big transformational things on faster or maybe to a greater extent than we're originally contemplating, that would be the path to going above that 90 to 100 million range right now.
kevin marek -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks a lot. appreciate it.

and our final question today comes from patrick baumann from j.p. morgan. please go ahead with your question. patrick, is it possible your phone is on mute?
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello? sorry about that. can you hear me now?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
oh, there we go.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yep.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, patrick.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
it was on mute. i apologize for that. erik, wondering if you could talk some more about what you're doing to the website and why is this just basic upgrades? or is it something more transformational in the way you interact? and then on this front, how would you benchmark yourself the website capabilities, i guess, msc direct versus kind of leaders in the industry at this point?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so, patrick, what i would say, and i'll answer your question on e-commerce. so to do it, i just want to underscore something kristen said, and it was in relation to mission critical and that was about a cultural change happening inside the company. and i bring this up in the context, you asked me about e-commerce because what kristen described happening in mission critical with it becoming a way of life and kind of like constantly raising the bar on ourselves. the same thing is happening everywhere in the company across our commercial organization, across marketing, across structural costs, you name it.
so i think what's happening here and the investments being made is we're raising the bar on ourselves. and it's certainly we benchmark peers inside and outside of the industry for capabilities. but i have to tell you, the north star for us that's driving these changes is the customer, how we can make their lives better, how their expectations with a younger millennial influence workforce growing as a percentage of total workforce. we -- this is about raising the bar on ourselves and doing better for customers.
so what we're doing is -- and i'd call it somewhere between an upgrade and transformational, but really changing the technology stack we use. and what that means is moving certainly more cloud-based where we can capture changes that happen overnight as opposed to needing to do upgrades. we're talking about using capabilities like ai-powered intelligence and logic that allows our search engines, our website, our whole digital experience with the customer to constantly improve. so i think some of this is around technology.
and then some of it is flat out just around customer experience and reducing friction and creating a better experience, a stickier experience for the customer. so that's really what's going on. it will happen. so we're beginning to put things into market in flight this quarter.
that'll continue. so we'll continue to launch sort of iterations along the way. it will be a big bang into the first couple of quarters of '22. and obviously, we'll be watching carefully for performance.
but i think this all goes back to the idea of raising the bar on what we expect out of ourselves and for our customers.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
what do you use to track kind of the progress? is it -- it sounds like some voice of customer or maybe there's -- there's got to be some metrics. you mentioned stickiness like site visits? is it sales metrics? is it revenue per visit? i don't know. what do you use --
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. so one of the things that are new and we've really upgraded our digital team, it's a strong group, and one of the things they've implemented is a weekly business review process where they're managing through a whole bunch of metrics. a couple of them you've mentioned, whether that's average order value, whether that's number of unique visits, whether that's conversion from the top of the funnel, meaning people coming to the site to the bottom of the funnel ordering and looking at all points along the funnel. so there's a bunch of metrics.
they're meeting weekly. and literally, when they see metrics move one way or another, they're adjusting by week. so if it's good, doubling down on it, if they see sort of a negative break in the trend, getting to root cause and then making adjustments real time. so that's happening on a weekly basis.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. helpful color, erik. and maybe one for kristen really quick, a follow-up on opex. you mentioned variable comp incentives as positive sequentially in the fourth quarter.
do you also expect any sequential net savings from the various programs that you have in-plant? and then also, what about freight cost, any update on what you're seeing in the p&l there going into year end?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. so sequentially, for mission critical, no impact from investments and savings on a net basis, it will be flat sequentially. and then on the freight side, sequentially, not really seeing any headwinds. freight is a bit more of a story for us on a year-over-year basis.
and that really has more to do with lower freight rates that we saw in the second half of '20 last year due to how we were shipping the ppe out to our customers where the customers were taking possession of that product. so we are seeing a bit of freight inflation creep in. sequentially, it's not an impact. it's maybe a million to 2 million on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, but we feel like freight is relatively well-controlled given what's happening in the macro environment.
we do a lot of small parcel shipment, and that is -- the sort of terms of how we pay for that are pretty well bound by our contract. expect to see a little bit more pressure coming in from our ltl shipments next year. but i think given what could be happening with freight from what we know of the macro environment, we're in a pretty good position.
patrick baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. helpful. thanks a lot, and appreciate the time. best of luck.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer

thank you, jaime, and good morning to everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me. as we continue working remotely at msc, please bear with us if we encounter any technical difficulties. and before i get into our cautionary language, i wanted to highlight that we recently created a micro site dedicated to corporate social responsibility.
for many years, the concept of doing the right thing has driven everything we do in all of our stakeholder interactions at msc. i invite you to learn more about our community relations, diversity and inclusion, corporate governance, and environment and sustainability efforts by visiting our website. this is only the very beginning of our esg journey, but we are committed to progress and continually striving for excellence. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments, as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on the investor relations section of our website.
let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation. our comments on this call, as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the impact of covid-19 on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition, expected future results, expected benefits from our investment in strategic plans and other initiatives, and expected future growth and profitability.
these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors in the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec, as well as in our other sec filings. these risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid-19. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by applicable law.
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures. please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation, which contain the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. i hope you enjoyed your holiday weekend. i'm excited to update you today on our progress this quarter. we are seeing the benefits of the strategic pivot that's been made by our company over the past few years.
we made significant investments across the organization to transition from a leading spot-buy provider to a mission-critical partner on the plant floor augmented by our spot-buy capabilities. with the bulk of the less visible changes completed, we outlined our plan to return to historic levels of revenue and earnings growth, consistent with the legacy of our company. mission critical is our program to translate those investments into superior financial performance. and we shared with you two goals that underpin our efforts: first, to accelerate market share capture with a target growth rate of at least 400 basis points above ip by the end of our fiscal 2023; second, to return roic into the high teens powered not only by leveraging growth, but also by structural cost takeout of 90 to $100 million also by the end of fiscal 2023.
this year, our fiscal 2021 began our proof of concept with our fiscal third quarter serving as the latest encouraging data point. with respect to revenues, we committed to achieve a minimum of 200 basis points of positive spread versus the ip by our fiscal fourth quarter. q3 is muted by ppe comps, but the non-safety and non-janitorial business grew about 21% year over year, and we expect our total company growth to meet or exceed our fiscal q4 commitment. this year, with the help of numerous structural cost reductions, we increased our customer-facing sales headcount and will continue doing so into fiscal 2022.
we've grown share in metalworking through investment and innovation that improve our customers' businesses. at the tail end of fiscal 2021 and into fiscal '22, we're implementing improvements in e-commerce. we started with a new production information system earlier this year and are now rolling out enhanced search capabilities, new user interfaces for both desktop and mobile, a new transactional engine, and overall improved functionality. we've committed to maintaining our gross margin through a series of initiatives, and excluding the writedown for ppe, we have done so.
the macro environment is driving price increases. and given our inventory turns and innovative merchandising and pricing programs, we expect strong realization to continue. finally, we've picked up the pace on structural cost takeout. we've already exceeded our $25 million cost takeout goal for fiscal 2021 for the full year.
looking ahead, fiscal 2022 is setting up even better than the current year. we will build on our momentum and continue making progress toward our goal of 400 basis points or more of market outgrowth as measured against the ip index. on the gross margin line, we expect inflationary pressures to continue. while purchase cost increases are beginning to make their way into our p&l, they will be offset by ongoing price realization, yielding a stable gross margin outlook year over year.
on the structural cost front, we'll deliver roughly $20 million of incremental savings on top of that, which has been achieved over the past two years. and that will include benefits from existing initiatives, which will deliver incremental savings during the first half of '22 plus benefits in the second half from new initiatives that we have yet to execute, along with a handful of more transformational projects that will deliver additional savings in '23 and beyond. we will once again reinvest a portion of these incremental savings into our five growth initiatives to build upon market share capture. nonetheless, we expect incremental margins at/or above 20%.
how far north they go will be a function of how high we can get revenue growth and how much price realization we see. with all of this as the backdrop, i'll now turn to the specifics of the quarter beginning with the external landscape. the economic environment improved significantly. most of our manufacturing end markets turned positive during the quarter, and this evidenced itself in ip readings that turned to double-digit growth in april and may and in sentiment readings, such as the mbi index, which are at very high levels.
all of this is supported by our customers' outlooks, which are robust. at the same time, the industrial economy is experiencing very real supply chain shortages and disruptions. these disruptions are evidencing themselves in product scarcity, freight delays, and extreme labor shortages that are resulting in significant availability and inflationary pressures. and we are certainly not immune to these challenges.
and in fact, we're seeing them play out. that said, we are very well-positioned to navigate the current environment, particularly when compared to the local and regional distributors who make up 70% of our market. msc's broad multi-brand product assortment, our high inventory levels, strong supplier relationships, and next-day delivery capabilities position us well to accelerate market share capture. additionally, the supply chain challenges are resulting in significant and growing inflation that is producing the most robust pricing environment we've seen in years.
turning now to our performance. you can see our reported numbers on slide 4 and adjusted numbers on slide 5. revenues were up 2.2% on an average daily sales basis as we're seeing continued sequential improvement in our sales levels. most notably, non-safety and non-janitorial product lines improved through the quarter from mid-single-digit declines in our second quarter to 21% growth in our third quarter.
sales of safety and janitorial products, as expected, given the significant surge during the pandemic last year, declined just over 40% for the quarter. looking at our performance by customer type and excluding for a moment, the safety and janitorial product lines, all of our customers, all types, were up strong double digits. however, including all product lines and given the extremely difficult comparisons, government sales declined nearly 40%. national accounts returned to growth by posting a low single-digit increase, while our core customers improved and grew in the mid-teens.
ccsg grew mid-single digits. june showed continued improvement with total company year-over-year growth estimated at 15.4%. our non-safety and non-janitorial growth is estimated at roughly 20%, while safety and janitorial are estimated to be down roughly 10% against last year's continued ppe surge. we expect strong growth rates in non-safety and non-janitorial products for the balance of the fiscal year.
on the pricing front, we've seen solid realization of the march price increase that we mentioned last quarter. and as a result, we saw a sequential lift in gross margin from our fiscal second quarter's adjusted rate of 42%. since that last call, we've seen continued significant pricing activity from our suppliers. and as a result, we've implemented a june price increase.
this is earlier than normal but certainly warranted given the environment. we will not hesitate to move again if suppliers continue raising their prices. beyond the numbers, we had a couple of positive developments during the quarter. one was the recovery of the nitrile glove impairment, which kristen will touch on in just a bit.
the other was the acquisition of a majority stake in the william hurst company in june. hurst is a metalworking distributor based in wichita, kansas with a heavy focus on the aerospace sector, and this deal is meaningful to msc in several ways. hurst goes to market with a highly specialized and highly technical sales force. it fills out a geography in which msc was underpenetrated and, more importantly, brings technical capabilities that we can leverage across the entire msc business.
aerospace is roughly 10% of total msc sales today. it's an industry that is poised for strong growth coming out of the pandemic, and the hurst platform will considerably enhance our effectiveness in serving and growing that portion of our business. hurst has been led by ceo, john mullen, who remains at the helm and retains a meaningful ownership stake in the business. i'll now turn things over to kristen to cover the financials and our mission-critical progress.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. i'll begin with a review of our fiscal third quarter and then update you on the progress of our mission-critical initiatives. on slide 4 of our presentation, you can see key metrics for the fiscal third quarter on a reported basis. slide 5 reflects our adjusted results.
our third-quarter sales were 866 million, up 3.8% versus the same quarter last year. we had one more selling day this year in our third quarter. so on an average daily sales basis, net sales increased 2.2%. erik gave some details on our sales growth, but i'll just reiterate that our non-safety and non-janitorial sales grew 21% in the quarter, while our safety and janitorial sales declined 42%.
moving to gross margins. execution and realization on our midyear price increase was solid. our gross margin for fiscal q3 was 42.3%, up 30 basis points sequentially after adjusting our inventory writedown from last quarter and down just 10 basis points from last year. looking ahead, we took our summer increase in early june in response to the continuing inflation we are seeing from our suppliers.
we expect the recent trending to continue and aim to achieve a gross margin for fiscal 2021 that is flat with fiscal 2020. operating expenses in the third quarter were 257.3 million or 29.7% of sales versus 242.8 million or 29.1% of sales in the prior year. our third quarter includes just 400,000 of legal costs associated with the loss recovery, which i'll discuss shortly. so opex as a percent of sales, excluding those costs, was the same as the gaap figure or 29.7%.
let me share a few more details on our third-quarter opex. as i mentioned on our last call, we expected opex to increase sequentially from our second quarter, not only by the variable operating expenses associated with higher sales but also due to expected higher incentive compensation, as well as growth investments related to mission critical. recall that our adjusted opex for q2 was 244 million. a 90 million increase in sales means roughly 9 million of variable-related opex.
the remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher incentive compensation. while mission-critical growth investments did increase sequentially, this was offset by an increase in mission-critical savings, which i'll speak to in more detail in a few moments. as you may have seen in our earnings release this morning, we had a very positive development regarding the nitrile glove impairment we announced in our fiscal first quarter. we're pleased to report that last month, we received a 20.8 million loss recovery of the original 26.7 million impairment loss recorded in q1.
that recovery is below the operating expense line in the p&l, but it does increase our gaap operating income such that our gaap operating margin for the quarter was 14.8%. excluding the 20.8 million loss recovery and associated legal fees, as well as restructuring charges during the quarter of 1.3 million, our adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. gaap earnings per share were $1.68. adjusted for the loss recovery, as well as restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.42.
turning to the balance sheet and moving ahead to slide 7. our free cash flow was 3 million in the third quarter, as compared to 49 million in the prior year. the largest contributors were our increasing inventory and accounts receivable balance as our sales picked up significantly in the quarter. i would also note that we repurchased 47 million of stock during the quarter or about 507,000 shares at an average price of 92.92 per share.
this underscores our ongoing commitment to a balanced capital allocation philosophy and our goal to maximize total shareholder returns. in fact, to date in our fiscal q4, we repurchased another 229,000 shares at an average price of $89.07. lastly, when it comes to cash flows, please note that the 20.8 million loss recovery was received in june and will therefore be reflected in our fiscal fourth-quarter cash flows. as of the end of fiscal q3, we were carrying 598 million of inventory, up 66 million from last quarter.
we're actively managing inventory levels to ensure we can support our customers as sales continue accelerating. therefore, inventory levels are likely to continue climbing in the fourth quarter. we still expect capital expenditures for the fiscal year of approximately 55 million, and we still expect our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income to be above 100% for fiscal 2021. our total debt as of the end of the third quarter was 759 million, reflecting a 75 million increase from our second quarter.
roughly two-thirds of that increase was used to repurchase shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. as for the composition of our debt, 187 million was on our revolving credit facility. about 200 million was under our uncommitted facilities, 20 million was short-term fixed-rate borrowings, and 345 million was long-term fixed-rate borrowings. cash and cash equivalents were 27 million, resulting in net debt of 732 million at the end of the quarter.
let me now provide you with an update on our mission critical productivity goals. on slide 8, you can see our original program goals of 90 to a hundred million of cost takeout through fiscal 2023, and that is versus fiscal 2019. our cumulative savings for the first half of fiscal '21 were 17 million, and we saved another 12 million in our third quarter bringing our year-to-date savings to 29 million against our goal of 25 million by the end of this year. we also had invested roughly to 7 to 8 million in the first half of fiscal '21, and we invested another $7 million in our third quarter, bringing our total year-to-date investments to 15 million, which compares to our original full-year target of 15 million.
given the success of the program through the first three quarters, we now expect to achieve savings for fiscal 2021 of roughly 40 million. regarding total investments for fiscal '21, we now expect roughly 25 million, which would result in net savings of 15 million for this year. before i turn it over to erik, let me leave you with some broad expectations for the coming quarters. with respect to sales, the difficult safety and janitorial comparisons will ease in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal '22.
we expect double-digit growth rates for the total business in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued strength into fiscal '22. for fiscal '21, we expect a low single-digit total company growth, and we aim to achieve gross margins that are flat with fiscal '20. in terms of adjusted operating expenses, sequentially from our third to fourth quarters, we will see a decline due to volume-based expenses from sequentially lower sales dollars and lower incentive compensation. with that in mind, we remain on track with our adjusted annual operating framework for fiscal 2021, which you can see on slide 9.
furthermore, and as erik mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve 20% or higher incremental margins in both fiscal '22 and fiscal 2023. and i'll now turn it back over to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. fiscal 2021 is finishing on a high note, and we expect that momentum to continue into fiscal '22. we are gaining steam internally, and our end markets are strengthening as evidenced by ip readings. the inflationary environment, along with our ongoing price realization should continue to support gross margins.
on the structural cost front, we've made strong progress on our mission critical program and will deliver further savings over the next two years and beyond. all of that should translate into incremental margins at/or above 20% for the next two years. i thank our team for all of their hard work and dedication, and we'll now open up the line for questions.

we will now begin the question and answer session. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from tommy moll from stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
erik, i wanted to start on price, cost. what inning does it feel like we're in to you in terms of this inflationary cycle? and more specifically to 2022, fair to discern that you're assuming roughly neutral price cost in that gross margin outlook for the year?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so, tommy, i would say that, generally, what happens, as you know, just as a little sort of background, early stage inflationary cycle, distributors like us, see positive price cost spread. and that's what we saw in fiscal '21 that allowed us to realize for us, particularly with where we have the growth engine pointed, there is a mix headwind that we've talked about in the business of 30 to 50 bps, depending upon how things move around. so to achieve a flat gross margin, we've done it two years in a row, the goal would be to make it three years in a row, plus or minus flat. that requires a positive price cost spread.
that was the case in '21. that would be the aim again in '22. so to answer your question, tommy, look, at some point, we're starting to see it now. we're starting to see the purchase cost escalation hit the p&l, right, which limits the upside.
but it does feel like there's a lot of legs to this inflation story. i always hesitate to predict the macro. but in terms of innings, it still feels like relative early innings. and i say that because of product scarcity with what's happening with freight and with what's happening with labor, the extreme shortages.
it just seems like there's still a ways to go. and that's consistent with most folks i talked to. so i would say still relatively early innings of the story, and hopefully, that can continue to fuel more price and positive price cost spread even as cost creep in.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, erik, that's helpful. kristen, maybe one for you on mission critical execution you have planned for 2022.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
timing of the savings versus the investments is always an important issue. so as we progress through the quarters, are there any that you would point out where savings would significantly be ahead of of investment or vice versa?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so tommy, it's going to be a bit narrower on the spread in the first half of the year, widening in the back half of the year. and you can kind of see if you look at what happened in q3 to q4 sequentially in '21, that net savings spread narrowed. it's going to stay a little narrower in q1 and q2 and then widen out again in the second half.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
i just said, based on current expectations, i think as i've articulated to you guys before, we have a pretty good pipeline of what projects are in there. and we have definitely shuffled timing on things as we progress through the year. so if we expect that to be significantly different, i'll make sure to signal that to all of you in the next call.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
fair to say, though, kristen, that in any given quarter, the expectation would be there's still a net savings spread? it's just a matter of the degree to it. yes. ok.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
correct. correct.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
tommy and kristen, the one thing i did want to add in was that's related to mission critical. other cost factors, like, tommy, if you're thinking about modeling out the quarter, so for instance, q1, like we had in this fourth quarter, we're facing a prior-year comp where there will be covid cost measure add-backs. so if you're thinking about like incrementals or costs, it will likely be muted in q1. we've got stuff going on early in the fiscal year.
the covid cost add-back comps is one. two, kristen mentioned the vaccine incentive and marketing program. those will both be first half of year events that will mute incrementals relative to what we'll see in the back half of the year.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. appreciate it, erik. i will turn it back.

the next question comes from ryan merkel from william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
hey, everyone. congrats on a good year of execution.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, thanks, ryan. how are you?
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
good. so my first question is on the fiscal '22 sales outlook. so what is your forecast for price inflation? and then is it fair to assume that there's some pent-up demand at your customers, erik, as supply chain issues get solved?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. i think, ryan, so two points. on price inflation, look, tough to forecast precisely. but what i would say is implicit in our assumption is a continued cadence.
this has been a very different year, and i expect the next fiscal year to be a very different year from kind of our typical cadence, ryan. and what i mean by that is you've been following us for a long time. typically, we'll have one big price increase late summer that takes us into the early fall. and then there'll be -- are midyear sometime early in the calendar the year that's usually of a lesser amount.
what we're seeing now is a more consistent cadence, price increases that aren't necessarily quite as big on a relative basis, but are more frequent given just the rapid fire inflation we're seeing. so that -- sort of continuing that drumbeat and that cadence is baked in. your second question has to do with pent-up demand. i think it's a really good point, ryan, and it was one we tried to get across in the prepared comments.
and tough to know precisely when but it does feel like, particularly for msc, we're heavily levered toward heavy manufacturing sectors. i mean the supply chain right now is really severe. and i'm sure you're hearing this everywhere. no surprise, no question it's constraining growth.
i think the good news is the fundamentals and the demand outlook seems solid. but we do believe that what this is essentially doing is extending the growth runway and the recovery runway for '22 and maybe even to '23.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and then second, just how are you thinking about the cadence of gross margin through '22? should gross margins be higher year over year in the first half and then bleed down a little bit in the second half?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so when i think about gross margin, what you've typically seen from us the past few years, q4 to q1 sequentially, is we tend to have a bump up -- q4, q1 sequentially, i would not expect that this year. and as erik articulated, we have really different timing happening right now related to the price increases. it's definitely going to look more even throughout the year than our margin patterns typically look.
there kind of tends to be like a little bit of an arc in q2, q3 and then comes back down in q4 with our seasonal decline. you'll still see that in the fourth quarter, just not to the same extent that we would typically see. so everything is basically going to look a little more even than it would if you look at sort of our historical sequential trending in margin. and again, it's, of course, based on what we know today about the pricing environment, costs coming online.
and as erik articulated, everything there is pretty dynamic right now. but i think that's how i'd tell you to think about the year shaping up at the moment.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. it's helpful. i'll pass it on. thanks.

the next question comes from michael mcginn from wells fargo. please go ahead.
mike mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning, everybody. i wanted to get a metals update from you. alcoa had some interesting comments about magnesium shortages, and there's a lot of concerns in china regarding the energy, nat gas prices and what the impact is having on the mills. can you give us like an impact on what potential lag would be from tungsten or alloys? or any sort of commentary you're hearing from rising raws there?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, mike, look, i would say i don't have any specific commentary to share on our primary metals segment, which for us is meaningful. it's not the biggest, but it's a meaningful segment. look, i think overall, we're hearing a very consistent pattern. and i think we're feeling the effects now and will continue certainly through the remainder of the calendar year, likely into '22.
i don't know -- i'm not hearing from our customer base, mike, that it necessarily gets way worse from here. but in terms of material shortages leading to product scarcity, leading to higher prices, longer lead time, we're living it now. we're feeling it now. i have not heard anything of late.
and we pulse check our field and our customer base regularly that would be a material step change from where we are now. that said, what i would say is it's pretty severe now.
mike mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. and one of the major suppliers of cutting tools out there is doing some acquisitions in the software space, cat. i just wanted to get your take on how well positioned you are, you think, to grow with those suppliers from a digital footprint standpoint and just emerging platforms out there like kind of like geometry and things of that nature?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. mike, look, what i would say there is we -- our whole -- we've sort of anchored the msc value proposition around helping our customers find productivity on the plant floor, speeding up throughput, finding cost out, getting their products out to their customers faster and solving labor challenges. that's where we sort of have our entire machine aimed. and that includes our people, and the analog and like getting product in and getting people on the plant floor, but it also includes digital technology.
we're doing some of it ourselves. we've talked about some of our own innovation. there's a lot of disruptive new technologies out there, many -- some of whom we've mentioned, some of whom have been acquired by suppliers. certainly, we see, if anything, technology is an accelerator for us to help us do more faster.
ultimately, what this all comes back to, though, is finding productivity for customers on the plant floor. that's where it's all aimed, and that's -- so using many of the ones you're speaking of and the supplier you're thinking of, certainly is a critical partner in helping us do that.
mike mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
got it. appreciate the time. best of luck.

the next question comes from hamzah mazari from jefferies. please go ahead.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. thank you. my first question is just around -- just free cash flow conversion. how you think about that metric as you sort of hit these goals of 400 bps of performance, roic, high teens? what does the free cash flow conversion look like relative to today? is there room to optimize that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. good morning, hamzah yes, so i'd say there's definitely room to optimize free cash flow. you probably heard us articulate before we've got different initiatives that we want to focus on specific to the balance sheet as we progress with mission critical. it hasn't been a big focus area for us so far in fiscal '21, but definitely an area we're more aggressively turning our sights to here coming in fiscal '22.
and then if you just think about kind of cash utilization in general, first half of '21, we were generating a lot of cash. things were still kind of sluggish. second half of '21, we've been utilizing a lot more cash as our sales pick back up as we built up our inventory to support our customers. so i would also expect kind of more of a stabilization of our free cash flow once we get through this kind of inventory build and settled into a little more of a kind of stable working capital pattern for us.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. very helpful. and just my follow-up question, i'll turn it over. could you just remind us how much of the portfolio today is levered to the production cycle -- the oem production cycle, factory floor relative to sort of just pure mro facility maintenance type product? just give us a sense of that.
i know you flagged automotive as seeing some supply chain issues. but just trying to get a sense of how much of the business today is purely mro, which may be a little more resilient to supply chain issues?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, fair, hamzah. and one thing i would say is that the supply chain issues we're seeing are across -- i think they're acute and heavy manufacturing, but they are across the board. and i think you'll probably -- if you pulse check the portfolio of distributors, you'll see it across the board, not just in heavy manufacturing. but to help you size it for us, i can sort of give you a couple of cuts and end market view and a product view.
what we've talked about is metalworking products, which obviously tend to be most heavily levered to a production environment are a little under half of revenues. and the balance would be made up of the rest of our portfolio of the class c parts and things like fittings, infuses and fasteners, safety and janitorial, and other mro. from an end market standpoint, would be another way to sort of get at that, and we've talked about kind of the five big heavy manufacturing end markets also around 50% of company revenues. so that sort of gives you, hopefully, a little bit of a feel for our exposure.
hamzah mazari -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

the next question comes from david manthey from baird. please go ahead.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes. thank you. good morning. first off, in your comments, you're saying 20% contribution margins in your likely growth scenarios.
but -- as i'm calculating this out, because of the seven extra days you have in 2022, that means reported growth is going to be 2 or 3 percentage points above ads, i believe? and then under that scenario, your framework sort of implies 15 to 20. so i'm just -- i'm hoping you can help me understand where the disconnect is? or what am i not understanding there?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so, dave, the framework that we put in the presentation and commented on is the ads framework. you're right. we do have the 53rd week.
and the way you can roughly size that is probably about 70 million on sales, rough numbers and added $0.15 on eps. and because of the flip-flop we have between; '22 and '23 on the extra week, we're very focused on working within the ads framework because of that change.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok. ok. and then as we're thinking about contribution margins, if price is a bigger component of growth here, and you're picking up 30 basis points from mission critical and gross margins are assumed to be roughly flat, thereto, i'm just trying to gauge the teams or the 20% contribution margin. i know there's other cost pressures here.
but with all of those positives lining up right now, why wouldn't we see higher-than-normal contribution margins at this point in the cycle?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. a few thoughts on that. i think the first thing, dave, is we are really optimistic about how '22 is setting up generally. the pricing environment is favorable.
we've seen early favorable results on price realization. feeling really good about mission critical. so i think it's a fair question. we're giving ourselves a bit of wiggle room in the range here because there's a lot of sort of macro things that play in '22 that may require us to respond differently.
we feel like we've got inflation pegged pretty well based on what we know right now, but we've already taken our inflation assumptions up a couple of times even in the second half of '21 here. and then the other thing i would add around why we may not be getting more aggressive on the incrementals is really around our investment expectations. so we've been really thoughtfully prioritizing investment as part of the mission critical initiatives. and if there's an opportunity for us to potentially do more investment, depending on how '22 plays out, that's something that we're going to be keeping an eye on and looking for opportunities to invest to have early payback that will help us drive additional growth in '23.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok. thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
i'll add is just -- and kristen laid it out in the framework, you think -- there is massive inflation happening right now across the -- so if you just combine the inflation number we gave at 25 million, which is significantly greater than we would see in a normal year on opex, plus 13 million in covid-related add-back and then the vaccine incentive and marketing program, that's $38 million right there out of the gate that has to be overcome. so we look -- we feel pretty good, like in this environment, to produce 20% plus incrementals in light of what we're seeing in cost inflation. we feel pretty good about.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok. thank you.

the next question comes from adam uhlman from cleveland research. please go ahead.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
hey, everybody. good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, adam.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
a couple of clarifications. i might have missed it earlier, but when we were talking about the mid to high single-digit revenue growth forecast. how much of that is price? i think you said that it's going to be building a little bit through the year. so is that like we go from 3% to like three and quarter, three and a half? or is that like three, four, five? could you just help me --
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
we have -- let's put it this way. yes, and i didn't put -- we're not disclosing a specific number, adam. but what i said is that it would be basically what's implied for fiscal '22 is a continuation of the pattern that we've seen over the past two, three quarters, which has been a more steady drumbeat of increases. so we didn't break out a specific number.
and obviously, as you can imagine, the price contribution varies in a mid-single digit or high single-digit range. it's a different number. we didn't break it out. but suffice it to say, the implied assumption is that we'll continue seeing steady price increases of moderate size throughout the fiscal year.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok. yes. i'm just trying to put in the context that the labor freight inflation of 25 million seems like a lot. as i understand, i think some of your shipping costs have been you've done a good job with contracts.
is it fair to say that most of that is labor? and then could you share any thoughts on -- is hiring folks for the fulfillment centers getting any easier with the enhanced federal benefits falling off?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. maybe i'll take the first part and then i'll let erik chime in on the second part of your question. so on the 25 million, the way that i would kind of think about that, it is more labor. i'd say roughly, it breaks down to -- a bit more than half of that is labor.
freight, we're expecting to go up about 20 bps. and then we've got some sort of inflation baked in on kind of other areas of operating expense. but yes, the labor is the biggest piece of that to your point. and then i think on the second part of your question, on the cfc staffing, erik, do you want to chime in on that one?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. sure, adam. what i would say is, i think we've -- it's been quite a challenge across the economy in several of our locations. we have already made some adjustments to wages to sign-on bonuses, etc., to respond to what's going on.
that is all implicit in our '22 and sort of captured in our '22 framework. what i would say is we are starting to see some benefit there from some of the moves made. the staffing is trending in the right direction. but obviously, we're nowhere near out of the woods.
and i think that cost not just for us, but for the entire economy right now.
adam uhlman -- cleveland research -- analyst
ok. got you. erik, could you share any stats on the wins that you guys are having with mission critical in terms of -- anything you could share on like new markets where you're getting more traction what the sales are active customer count or anything along those lines?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, sure. so maybe what i'll do, adam, and look, i think sort of pulling back up for a second, and i'll give you some -- a few things that we're tracking carefully. look, i feel like momentum is picking up here. and this transformation story that we've had underway for a while is starting to yield results.
on the top line, we talked about we had said, ""hey, we thought ip was the best proxy over a long period of time for market share capture."" we are seeing that spread start to widen. we feel like in this environment, product availability and solving customers' labor challenges really set up nicely for us to accelerate share gains. so i think overall, we're picking up steam. and i think what i'd point to is really the five key growth levers.
that's sort of where we're heads down focused. so metalworking being the first. we've expanded the size of the team. we are approaching 10% share in metalworking.
we still feel like we've got plenty of room. we've got a new technology in millmax that's being rolled out. still early stages should fuel that. on the selling of the portfolio front, our big focus has been ccsg and our vmi business, which we're seeing that business return to double digits.
solutions is another big area for us. and if you recall, solutions includes vending, it includes vmi, and it includes implant. so on implant, in particular, we had talked about taking that portion of the business, which, by the way, right now, is really resonating with customers because they need help. it's helping them close a labor gap.
but what we had talked about is moving that business from 5 to 10% of sales, that's at seven. so we saw a nice healthy jump in a year. we also -- vmi and vending the other portions of solutions, we definitely saw a dip during covid. signings are pretty much getting back this past month in september, got back to pre-covid levels.
and so all in, we're seeing solutions revenues as a percentage of total from customers with solutions, that's implant vmi vending in the mid-50s as a percentage of total sales. so we feel good about that. fourth area is digital. so we talked about within digital, the primary focus for the last couple of quarters into '22 was going to be on mscdirect.com.
so you'll recall our e-commerce as a percentage of total revenues hovers around 60. it had dropped a little bit during the pandemic, primarily because of some of the large ppe sales that did not go through the e-com. but that number is back to the high watermark of around 60. i think more significantly, though, adam, under the covers, we look specifically at mscdirect.com to say, ""are we getting payback?"" we're seeing mscdirect.com revenues as a percentage of sales actually hit our high watermark, greater than 50% of that total e-commerce number, but it actually hit our high watermark in q4.
and then last but not least is government, where we're feeling really good about our competitive position in government, and it sounds ironic, when i'm talking -- coming off of a quarter with a minus 30% growth number, but that really is about safety and janitorial comps. there, we're looking specifically at total customer count and new customer wins. we feel quite good about our position in government. so sort of that's a rundown of the big five, as we call it, which is the five levers that we're focused on to widen the market share spread.

the next question comes from steve barger from keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. erik, in the pandemic, there was a lot of concern about double ordering of safety equipment. now that we're seeing the supply chain constraints, are there concerns about double ordering or unusual inventory build at customers for traditional products?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. steve, it's actually a great question. it's something we monitor carefully. what i would say is, first of all, we're still watching safety and janitorial, which tends to ebb and flow a bit.
overall, what i would say is we're not seeing a significant change in our -- where we would see that play out as our order cancellation rate and [inaudible] a significant change there. so we are monitoring it carefully. but to date, i would say nothing i'd call out like we were talking about last year with the safety supplies.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and i know you have a lot of diverse products across categories like a good, better, best exposure. but are there any categories where there are real pinch points and you just can't get stuff right now? or what's the -- where are you having the most trouble sourcing?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, steve. so i would say issue no.1 is overseas is really -- just to put it bluntly, is -- the overseas supply chain right now globally is a mess. so i think the fortunate position for msc is as a percentage of our total purchases and our total sales, global sourcing is relatively low for us. so i think that buffers us somewhat and gives us a competitive advantage with customers.
but that -- where that happens, that is the most acute. i think the other thing that's an advantage for msc is even where we global source, as you said, most of the lines where we offer an imported product, we have domestic alternatives. beyond the imports, what i would say is, look, there's a few branded industry suppliers, without getting into names, but there's a few that have been hit acutely hard, whether it's micro company-specific issues or the sector that they're in. so we have some pain points with specific suppliers.
i wouldn't necessarily call out a product line or two, more so specific suppliers. and again, the nice thing is with the multiple brand choices we are able to offer customers alternatives. and at the same time, it's why you're seeing our inventory go up is to make sure that as lead times extend, we're in a position to be there for our customers because right now, steve, i will tell you, availability wins out nearly all the time at the moment.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. and just as a follow-up, what kind of products do you get most from overseas? is it hand tools, or gloves, or whatever? just what are you sourcing from over there?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so we actually -- it's somewhat across the board. so i mean we have some of our cutting tool and metalworking offering is sourced overseas. certainly, some of our class c offering is sourced overseas. we do, to some degree, some of the lines like you mentioned, like hand tools, where we do some private branding.
but again, as a percentage of total, i think for us relative to peers is not that great.
steve barger -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got you. thank you.

the next question comes from chris dankert from loop capital. please go ahead.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, chris.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
i guess, first off, we touched on it earlier on the government side, but what does large account growth look like if you pulled that kind of big comp headwind out of there? how is the rest of the market is trending on national accounts?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so we had said -- i think our national accounts number was mid-teens, chris. there is some -- and i don't have the number offhand. i'm sure there is some safety janitorial comp that number because some of our -- along with the government, but there were some large accounts. look, what i would say, probably just a good proxy.
chris, would be if you just look total company and say total company sales without the safety janitorial at 20%, so it gives you a feel for how the underlying business is performing. what i would say is on the large accounts, the national accounts side, we are encouraged by progress there. and what i'd call out that's more specific to that area is we did have a leadership change a couple of quarters back. we put somebody in who is a strong longtime msc sales leader, who's had a great track rod and moved into large accounts.
we're seeing him move the needle relatively quickly there.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. got a good deal. and then, i guess, maybe just remind us what percent of national accounts contracts can be negotiation within the next 12 months versus those are kind of on a more multiyear cycle? just trying to size the ability to really keep pace with inflation if things keep heating up here.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. chris, what i would say, most of our national accounts are in a contract. most of the times, there is an annual cycle. so while quarter to quarter it may be tricky to keep up precisely over the course of a year, it is something we are able to do.
and what i would say is now so more than ever. chris, this is a very different environment from what we've seen in past cycles. so customers understand if we talk about the need to open a negotiation on price, whereas the same customer that three years ago would have said go pound salt, there's more of a conversation now because of the environment.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and i guess if i could just sneak one more in here.
just we touched on it with e-commerce, but any update specifically on kind of the enhanced search, the transactional engine rollout? just anything specifically on some of those new tools that are kind of helping the sales force today?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. on e-commerce, the new search tool is in the market now. the new user experience is in the market now. so we've launched.
and what i would say is those are constantly fine-tuned to get better and better. we rolled them out during our fiscal fourth quarter. so it's still pretty early. we did like -- so we have sort of the macro, the big metric we track is what are the percent of company revenues flowing through mscdirect.com.
we saw a nice tick up from q3 to q4. underneath that, though, our e-commerce team, you can imagine they're measuring 10 ways until sunday, basically measuring what we call top of funnel to bottom of funnel. meaning for every visitor to the site, what percentage translates into orders, which is a gauge of effectiveness of the site. early signs are positive there.
again, still very early. beyond search and user experience, we have new features coming out. basically, through the first half -- at least to the first half of the fiscal, we'll continue to flow in. and we'll keep fine-tuning the ones that have already been rolled out like search and ux.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.

our last question comes from pat baumann from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, erik. hi, kristen. thanks for taking my questions here.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, pat.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
good morning. you just mentioned, i think, the leadership change in national accounts. i'm not sure if i missed this, but did you address the change in overall sales leadership that was announced earlier this month? kind of interested in what drove the change? what is your responsibilities were at this point? how it impacts the transformation, if at all? and then also is the interim replacement kind of longer-term solution here?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes. so i didn't touch on it in the prepared remarks because we did have the press release earlier on in the month. ed -- look, eddie did a really nice job for us in sort of fine-tuning the sales playbook and driving execution. and so we really appreciate his contributions.
that said, i have to tell you, i'm really excited by kim schachler taking over. it's on an interim basis. but at the moment, i can tell you there's no search. kim has been with us for 15 years, and another 15 years before that with j&l, which was a metalworking distributor we acquired.
she's one of the most well-respected people, not just in the company, but in the industry with the supplier community, especially. she's excited. i can tell you we've got thousands of people in the field between outside and customer care that are ready to run through a brick wall for kim. and i think the punchline, pat, what you can expect is no change in the playbook.
i think the playbook that eddie built with the team is the right one, kim is going to take it and drive it, and i think rally the team around it.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. ok. helpful. and then maybe zooming out a little bit just on pricing.
just want to kind of perspective on how you view your current positioning, i guess, on piece price versus the industry? and what i mean by that is, are there any particular product or customer categories where you're less competitive in today that you think you might need to adjust over time in order to grow faster? and then just as a refresh, kind of what percentage of the portfolio today is spot buy versus what you're moving more toward the contract and solutions-based type of sales?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so, pat, i'll take it and start. first question on competitiveness of pricing. look, i think the perspective we've always had at msc is our goal was never to match market on price. and that doesn't mean we don't at times for large orders, etc., or for big customers.
but in general, our pricing philosophy is such that our goal is to help customers bring down their total cost. and if we got into a game of saying the piece price is where we win, we think that's a losing battle. and by the way, for our customers, what we share with them is the cost of the products that they're buying from us, industrial supplies, represent well under 10% of the total cost for a manufacturer. the two single biggest chunks are labor and materials.
so msc has -- especially with this mission critical pivot that we've made, we've really aimed and pointed the lens at the 50%, 70% plus that's labor and materials and helping customers drive cost. to do that, we're investing like crazy in technical resources, in digital resources, in products, etc. we've got to be able to charge a premium or we can't afford it. so i feel good about our price position overall.
pricing has become much more sophisticated in the world and inside the company. so we have a team that's constantly monitoring, and i would tell you, constantly fine-tuning. so what you'd hear from them is there's always areas that need to be tuned up or down. but in general, we feel good about our positioning.
there was another part to your question, pat, and i think it had to do with the -- how the business is migrating?
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes, i guess i was wondering the percentage that today is kind of spot by oriented versus more solutions or contract-oriented?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so i shared a metric in one of the responses. sort of as we look at the sort of like the end state of where we're headed with this mission critical program, getting closer to customers, one way we get closer is by embedding not just our salesperson, but a solution inside the customer, whether that's an implant vending vmi. that percentage of business is in the mid-50s right now as a percent of total. that would be sort of one proxy.
and then i think beyond that, if you look at where we have a relationship, and it's not just transactional, it would be where we have a salesperson calling on an account, be that an outside person or somebody via phone because that's where we're doing more than just providing a spot by service. that percentage of revenues is closer to 90.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. helpful. and then kind of more of a shorter-term question. the extra week you get in fiscal '22, does that -- would you normally get extra leverage out of that extra week? so is that -- i guess is the 20% incremental, is that just kind of on a normal 52-week basis? and then you have an extra week, which should let you get a little bit better than that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so the framework is definitely on an ads basis, and we're doing that because the inverse of what happens in '22, of course, happens in '23. so we'll continue to give the framework on an ads basis, which is what the 20% incrementals are based on.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
helpful. ok. thanks a lot. i appreciate the color and best of luck, guys.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thanks.

good morning, and welcome to the msc industrial supply fiscal 2021 fourth-quarter and full-year conference call. [operator instructions]. please note, this event is being recorded. i'd now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer.
please go ahead.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, jason, and good morning to everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me. we continue to work remotely at msc. so please bear with us if we encounter any technical difficulties.
like last quarter, when i highlighted our recently created micro site dedicated to corporate social responsibility, i'd like to invite you to visit our completely redesigned investor relations web page. we have made it much easier to find information and add content we think you will find useful. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments, as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on our investor relations web page. let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of our accompanying presentation.
our comments on this call, as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the impact of covid-19 on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition, expected future results, expected benefits from our investment and strategic plans and other initiatives, and expected future growth and profitability. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those incubated by these statements. information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors and md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec, as well as in our other sec filings.
these risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid-19. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements except as required by applicable law. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures.
please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation, which contain the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. good morning, and thanks for joining us today. i hope that everybody remains safe and healthy. as we close the books on fiscal '21 and we kick off our fiscal '22, our transformation story is gaining steam.
several years ago, we began repositioning msc from strictly a spot-buy supplier to a mission-critical partner on the plant floor of industrial north america. along the way, we execute several significant changes. we reimagined our value proposition, reengineered our supply chain, reshaped our sales force, and updated our technology infrastructure. the pandemic came, and we used it as a catalyst to accelerate the path we were already on.
we took several bold steps to rethink how we work and to redeploy capital from back office into growth. at the start of fiscal '21, we rolled out mission critical, which was our plan to translate these changes into superior financial performance, and we outlined two, three-year goals. first, to accelerate market share gains. our stated target was to reach at least 400 basis points of growth above the ip index by the end of our fiscal 2023.
our first base camp would be this past quarter, our fiscal '21 fourth quarter, where we expect it to be at least 200 basis points above ip. the second goal was to restore return on invested capital, or roic, into the high teens by the end of fiscal 2023. and we would achieve this by leveraging growth, by executing on gross margin initiatives, and by delivering structural cost takeout of 90 to $100 million, helping to reduce opex as a percentage of sales by at least 200 basis points over that time period. we're now one year into our mission critical journey, and i am very encouraged by progress.
with respect to our first goal market share capture, we're gaining momentum. our q4 performance was strong, with ads growth of roughly 500 basis points above ip. our growth continues to be powered by the execution of the five growth levers that we outlined at the start of the fiscal '21. and those are metalworking, solutions, selling our portfolio, digital, and diversified end markets.
we're also seeing improvement in roic. after adjusting out nonrecurring costs, adjusted roic was 15.4% at the end of q4, an improvement of approximately 60 basis points over the past year. and there's two important drivers behind this. first, profitability.
we held gross margins flat on higher sales dollars and had strong price realization in a robust inflationary period to offset mix headwinds. our structural cost takeout also helped drive profitability, and i'll speak more to that in just a minute. the second driver of improved roic was our balance sheet, as we brought down average working capital versus prior year. i'd add that our board just approved roic as a metric driving long-term incentive compensation.
back to our mission critical program. we achieved $40 million of cost savings in fiscal '21, exceeding our original target of 25 million. and we're redeploying a good portion of these savings back into growth investments that will further fuel revenue growth, and hence, improve operating leverage. we've redeployed field sales headcount from back-office into growth drivers, including metalworking, government, and our business development program.
we're approaching pre-covid levels on our vending machine signings and our implant program is gaining traction, finishing fiscal '21 at just over 7% of company sales, as compared to 5% a year ago. we continue to upgrade our web infrastructure, including a new search engine, product information platform, and user experience. these have started, and it will continue to drive improved performance through e-commerce. we've executed all of this in the face of very challenging conditions, including severe supply chain disruptions, substantial cost inflation, and extreme labor shortages.
and while we're certainly not immune to these challenges, i've been quite pleased with our team's response to navigating these choppy waters. we've increased inventory significantly and are leveraging our good, better, best product offering to offer our customers alternatives. as a result, while our service level is not yet back to pre-covid levels, it is well above most of the industry and is fueling market share capture. on the cost side, we are seeing significant inflation in wages, freight, product costs, and more, and our team has worked hard to minimize the impact of these.
our structural cost and productivity efforts are buffering the effects on our p&l. looking ahead to fiscal '22, our outlook is positive. we intend to build on this momentum despite the near-term challenges with supply chain disruption and inflation. with respect to revenue growth, we're aiming for at least 300 basis points of growth above ip, on our way to 400 basis points or more for fiscal 2023.
we'll target holding gross margins roughly flat for the third consecutive year by continuing strong price execution. on the structural cost front, we expect to deliver roughly $25 million in incremental savings on top of the 40 million in fiscal 2021. as kristen will describe in just a bit, we expect this to yield incremental margins of 20% in the likely scenarios for the year. i'll now turn to the details of the quarter and the latest test to what we see on landscape.
the demand environment remained strong during our fiscal fourth quarter. the majority of our manufacturing end markets remain robust, with some isolated but acute pockets of softness like automotive. this is reflected in the ip reading that continues to show growth and in sentiment reading such as the mbi index, which remain at high levels. that said, the supply chain shortages and disruptions that we began to see in our fiscal third quarter have increased.
and while hard to quantify, are certainly constraining growth across the industrial economy in the near term. product scarcity, freight delays and extreme labor shortages are also resulting in significant inflationary pressures. we are well positioned to navigate this environment, particularly when compared to the local and regional distributors who make up 70% of our market. msc's broad multi-brand product assortment, our high inventory levels, strong supplier relationships, and next-day delivery capabilities are all strengths that allow us to accelerate market share capture.
turning to our performance. you can see our reported numbers on slide 4 and adjusted numbers on slide 5. sales were up 11.1%, or 12.9% on an average daily sales basis. our non-safety and non-janitorial product lines grew 20%, while sales of safety and janitorial products declined roughly 14%.
looking at our performance by customer type. government sales declined nearly 30% due to difficult janitorial and safety comps. national accounts improved their growth rate into the mid-teens, while our core customers maintained their growth rates. dcsg grew in the low double digits.
september continued the trend of a low double-digit growth rate with ads growth of 11.1%. our non-safety and non-janitorial growth was roughly 15% [inaudible] 11%. keep in mind that the difficult safety and janitorial prior-year comparisons continue for the first half of our fiscal '22 and particularly the rest of our fiscal first quarter before easing in the back half of the year. kristen will speak more about our fiscal '22 assumptions when she discusses our annual operating margin framework in just a bit.
with regards to the pricing environment, it remains strong as product inflation continues pretty much across the board. supplier pricing moves led us to take another increase in august, and solid realization of our june increase allowed us to post the gross margin of 42% for the quarter, down just 30 basis points from our fiscal third quarter, which is less than our typical seasonal drop. continued price escalations from suppliers and increasing inbound freight costs will be a headwind in the coming quarters, and we'll look to offset this with further pricing actions. i'll now turn things over to kristen, who will cover our financials, mission critical progress, and our fiscal '22 annual operating margin framework.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. i'll begin with a review of our fiscal fourth quarter and then update you on the progress of our mission critical initiative. before i turn it back over to erik, i'll close with our thoughts on fiscal 2022 and our annual operating margin framework. on slide 4 of our presentation, you can see key metrics for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year on a reported basis.
slide 5 reflects the adjusted results, which will be my primary focus this morning. our fourth-quarter sales were 831 million, up 11.1% versus the same quarter last year. we had one less selling day this year in our fourth quarter. so on an average daily sales basis, net sales increased 12.9%.
erik gave some details on our sales growth, but i'll just reiterate that the non-safety and non-janitorial ads sales grew 20% in the quarter, while our safety and janitorial sales declined 14%. our gross margin for fiscal q4 was 42%. and as erik mentioned, was down 30 basis points from our third quarter and up 40 basis points from last year. operating expenses in the fourth quarter were 253.3 million or 30.5% of sales, versus 227 million or 30.4% of sales in the prior year.
it's worth noting that our fourth quarter operating expenses include nearly 8 million of expense add-back from prior year covid cost containment measures. opex also increased as inflation challenges began in the fourth quarter. excluding approximately $1 million of acquisition-related costs, adjusted opex was 252.1 million or 30.3 as a percent of sales. as expected, our adjusted operating expenses came down sequentially from q3 due to volume-based expenses from sequentially lower sales dollars and lower incentive compensation.
we also incurred approximately 4.4 million of restructuring and other related charges in the quarter. our operating margin was 11%, compared to 9.8% in the same period last year. excluding the acquisition-related costs, as well as the restructuring and other related costs, our adjusted operating margin was 11.7%, versus an adjusted 11.2% in the prior year. adjusted incremental margin for our fiscal fourth quarter was 15.3%.
gaap earnings per share were $1.18, as compared to $0.94 in the same prior-year period. adjusted for the acquisition-related costs, as well as restructuring and other charges, adjusted earnings per share were $1.26 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 in the prior-year period, an increase of 15.6%. turning to the balance sheet and moving ahead to slide 9. our free cash flow was 69 million in the fourth quarter, as compared to 171 million in the prior year.
the largest contributor to the decline were increasing inventory and accounts receivable balances relating to our year-over-year sales lift. i would also note that we repurchased 20 million of stock during the quarter or about 231,000 shares at an average price of 89.08 per share. as of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we were carrying 624 million of inventory, up 26 million from last quarter. we're actively managing inventory levels to support our customers as sales continue accelerating and in light of the ongoing supply chain disruptions.
our capital expenditures were 16 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year, were 54 million, within our expected range of 50 to 60 million. in addition, our fiscal year 2021 annual cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income was strong at 103%. our total debt at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was 786 million, reflecting a 27 million increase from our third quarter. as for the composition of our debt, 234 million was on our revolving credit facility, about 200 million was under our uncommitted facilities, and approximately 350 million was long-term fixed rate borrowings.
cash and cash equivalents were 40 million, resulting in net debt of 746 million at the end of the quarter. as of the end of september, our net debt was down to 728 million. let me now provide an update on our mission critical productivity goals. our original program goal was to deliver 90 to 100 million of cost takeout through fiscal 2023, and that is versus fiscal 2019.
as you can see on slide 10, our cumulative savings for fiscal year 2021 were 40 million against our original goal of 25 million and our revised goal of 40 million. we also invested roughly 23 million in fiscal 2021, which compares to our revised full-year target of 25 million. as we have already begun our fiscal '22, i'll give you our expectations for this year. we expect additional gross savings in fiscal '22 of 25 million and additional investments of 15 million.
these investments will continue to fuel share gains by building out our digital platform and expanding our sales force. that will result in additional net savings for mission critical initiatives of roughly 10 million. as a result of our strong progress on mission critical savings, we are increasing our total savings target to a minimum of 100 million through the end of fiscal '23, as compared to our fiscal '19 baseline. now let's turn to the fiscal year 2022 adjusted operating margin framework, which is shown on slide 11.
operating margins will naturally vary based on our sales levels. the punchline is that, on an average daily sales basis, sales are up high single digits. we would expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.3%, plus or minus 30 basis points. and if sales are up mid-single digits, we would expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12%, also plus or minus 30 basis points.
this means we expect to achieve 20% adjusted incremental margins at our likely revenue growth range of mid to high single-digit growth. let me cover some of our assumptions behind the framework. with regard to sales levels, we are assuming an ip index somewhere between low to mid-single-digit growth, and we are targeting market outgrowth of roughly 300 basis points. that yields company growth on an ads basis in the mid to high single digits.
we're optimistic about our growth runway as most of our end markets are still in the early stages of recovery. we aim to hold gross margins roughly flat with fiscal '21. it's worth noting that in addition to volume-related expenses, we will face several challenging headwinds, such as labor and freight inflation of nearly 25 million, as well as covid cost add-backs and additional covid-related costs of more than 13 million. i would point out that 3 million of those costs are for an incentive and marketing campaign to help us achieve compliance with the federal contractor vaccination mandate.
these costs will likely occur in our first quarter. please note that the quarterly progression, whether we're talking about sales growth or profitability levels, will not be a straight line. for example, we expect our fiscal first-quarter sales to face more difficult comparisons due to safety, janitorial, and government sales. likewise, operating expenses will also face difficult comparisons in the first half of fiscal '22 as covid-related cost-saving measures were still in place in the first half of fiscal 2021.
finally, keep in mind that our fiscal year '22 includes a 53rd week, and you can find our fiscal calendar on our ir website. i'll now turn it back to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, kristen. our mission critical transformation is gaining speed. with our recent q4 performance as another strong data point, our market share capture rate is growing. our efforts around gross margin and productivity improvements are beginning to lift roic toward our fy fiscal '23 goal of high teens.
looking to fiscal '22, we're set up for a strong year, including 20% incremental margins in our likely growth range. and we're accomplishing all of this in the face of difficult conditions. i'd like to thank our entire team of msc associates for their hard work during challenging times. your work is allowing msc to stand out from competition and delight our customers.
thanks, and we'll now open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from tommy moll of stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
morning, tommy.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
morning, tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i wanted to start off with the update you gave for the adjusted operating -- framework for the year with the low double-digit, a scenario -- now in place, what were some of the factors that gave you the confidence to go ahead and add that to the outlook? and specifically, what i'm trying to understand is just how much was it progress toward some of the pricing realization versus where there some changes in the markets where you got better visibility or greater confidence and how the year might shape up?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. tommy, i would say you have a couple of things going on. first and foremost, we're seeing it in the numbers. so we're looking at actual performance.
and basically, especially if you take out, which we had a really strange first two weeks of january with covid. but if you put that aside, the underlying performance of the business justifies it. so i think that's one we're actually seeing in the numbers. number two, the outlook remains robust.
and look, i think it's been a strong outlook. it continues, if anything to firm up, but it looks as good as it did. and then the third thing, as you mentioned, is price realization, with this level of pricing and inflation in the market, it certainly creates an additional tailwind. you can see that on our growth decomposition.
so, sitting here halfway through the year with those three factors, we feel like if things continue as they've been running, that's where we should land.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
 thanks, erik. and just to follow up on some of the countermeasures you've taken around pricing. last quarter, you gave us some anecdotal examples of what those might be. so anything you could do to refresh us there just on contracting strategy? or anything else would be helpful.
and i guess a broader question. you've announced some of these pricing initiatives in an inflationary environment, partly as a response to some of those pressures. but longer term, a more nimble organization around pricing has got to be a good thing under any kind of circumstances. and so, what can you talk to us -- talk to in terms of cultural shifts and the organization, incentive structures that may have changed around the sales force? all aimed at some of these near-term goals on on price cost, but maybe with some long-term benefit to the organization more broadly.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
tommy, you're spot on. in fact, a lot of the work. obviously, look, there's a lift that came from a sizable price increase, but we started and we called this out in the last call. we started gaining traction before the january move.
so, there is more going on than just raising prices. there is a big effort underway. you referred to it as being more nimble, more agile. building our muscle.
in our sales organization, around how to talk to customers about price, and that is clearly resulting in better realization rates. and as you suggest, for us, this is something that is -- as or more important, when inflation settles down and it's back to normal as it is right now, when it's relatively easy to explain a price increase. i think the other thing i call out tommy, that's helping us a lot. i mentioned it in the prepared remarks, which is the work we're doing with our customers to take cost out of their business.
you know, every customer right now understands when you come to them and talk about the need for a price increase, everyone gets it. however, our customers are getting squeezed and the call out, the cry for help is greater now than ever for saying, ""look, if you're going to come in with a price increase, help me offset it."" and, you know, our technical experts, that's really where they're spending their time now inside of the plants of our customers, figuring out how to offset the pricing. and i think that's really resonating and helping us improve realization.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks, erik. i appreciate it. and i'll turn it back.

the next question comes from hamzah mazari of jefferies. please go ahead.
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah. could you just remind us how much of your business is levered to oem production? and then along with that, maybe just comment on what you're hearing from your customer base or what they're seeing around supply chain issues? do you think that's been a governor at all on your organic growth?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
mario, good morning. so first off, look, i think the best way to think about our business is you can see on the op stat manufacturing as a percentage of total company, that's your best proxy. look, we are within manufacturing, we tend to be heavily levered toward manufacturers that are cutting removing metal, working with metal. that's -- the guts of our business.
i would say a resounding yes, mario, that the supply chain constraints, there is a lot of talk in the headlines that they're easing. i will tell you on the ground, it's not happening quickly, and we don't see it going away any time soon. it is absolutely constraining growth. so there is, i guess, good news, bad news, from our perspective.
the good news is, there is pent up business here and that the demand is stronger than the numbers are showing because of limited supply. no question. and that's across the board from our customers, our own issues with lead time and our suppliers. so i think, the answer is yes.
and look, to be honest, we don't see the supply chain relieving the bottlenecks, we're leaving overnight. certainly, now you compound that with the russia-ukraine situation. but again, i think the good news story there, yes, there is some pent up demand not getting filled right now. 
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then just for my follow up. maybe i missed it in the prepared remarks, but i guess what growth are you specifically seeing within vending? i think -- the comment was more or less around that being now 1% or -- it grew 1% or 100 bips as part of your mix. but, did you provide an actual growth rate around that? and then could you also just remind us how big that market or how big that addressable market is for you guys?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. mario, the number we had said in the script was we're seeing vending grow as a percentage of revenue about 100 basis points over prior year, and borrowers are lending total addressable market. erik, do you want to take that? -- yeah. thanks.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
look, i would say, mario, we've now publicly sized it specifically, but i would say if you take it, i would put it beyond vending and put the umbrella around services in our business and inventory management services. specifically, if you umbrella all of the concepts in which msc is on the plant floor, that would be vending, bmi and our implant program, where we directly have a presence that is somewhere around half the business today. and we certainly think if you look moving forward and think about the growth algorithm for the company, at least that if not more than half of the growth is likely to come from those areas as part of the puzzle that being vending bmi and a -- an implants. 
mario cortellacci -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from michael mcginn of wells fargo. please go ahead.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. going back to your national account progress and the momentum within federal and the military. congrats on the win there. so squaring the numbers, to my knowledge, i thought federal was maybe high single-digit percent of sales and defense, maybe closer to mid single-digit.
so i just wanted to get your perspective on those numbers, and whether these new contracts are some nice singles and doubles, but maybe the building blocks for other wins you have in the pipeline with the recent defense budget negotiations?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. mike, so -- what we've shared, if you say government in total, that's federal plus state and it's moved around a lot, particularly through the last two years during the pandemic. but tends to run high single-digits as a percent of total company sales. the split we've been calling out is two thirds of that is federal and one third of that is state.
now, that also moves around quarter to quarter, but over time, that's been the breakout. yeah, i would say -- a couple of things i'd say about the public sector group for us. number one is, yeah, we're pretty encouraged by recent wins. we talked about one here which look, we're proud to be able to service the marine corps, particularly at a time like now.
there have been other wins, not quite as large and not quite as high profile, but other wins fueling our confidence there. so we are seeing momentum really pick up with our execution on public sector. so moving forward, would it be possible to see that number of of total government business in the federal move up as a percentage of sales -- likely? yes, we would. and that'll probably happen, mike, gradually, these things tend to -- there's a whole implementation timeline and it should begin scaling over the next quarter or two.
but yeah, it would be likely that government could take up as a percentage of sales as a result of the wins.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
right. i appreciate the caller. and then maybe an update on capital allocation. it looks like your cash flow was fully burdened or overly burdened with the double regular dividend payment this quarter, balance sheet in good shape.
how do you think about capital allocation with the shares at these levels?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. mike, let me -- a lot little color on working capital. and then, erik, do you want to jump in on any of the other aspects of capital allocation go forward. but i think, mike, just specific to the working capital utilization, we're expecting some recovery there.
but we're not being overly skimpy with how we're thinking about inventory right now. we are flexing the balance sheet there strategically, making sure we're building a buffer where we can to service our customers. so i don't anticipate inventory freeing up as a use of cash anytime soon. and then accounts receivable, pleased with how that's just been growing in relation to sales, there are definitely some things that we're looking at through the lens of mission critical that are going to help us on working capital.
but i'd say that a lot of those are just coming online. i think there's some opportunity for them to help us with cash flow in the second half, definitely picking up steam into '23. so that's the working capital angle i'd off around capital allocation. i think with respect to m&a, we're always looking at potential interesting bolt on acquisitions, we've seen some acceleration in those areas probably, i don't know, within the last year or so i would say, erik, you want to add anything on capital allocation?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
i think by and large, kristen, you have working capital. our philosophy -- on capital allocation remains pretty consistent. so we're focused. look, priorities one a, one b or organic reinvestment, we like what we're seeing with the organic returns right now.
so we're going to continue fueling those continued steady growth in the ordinary dividend. and then, we feel very comfortable with where our leverage ratio is now. and look, we'll as you know, as we'll look at things on a risk adjusted return, i think the one thing to call out, yeah, there the m&a funnel -- the rate and pace of discussions probably is heated up over the last several quarters. but if we do anything on the m&a front, we'll be sticking to our knitting and that that means metal working, it means class seats or oem fasteners, something that bolts on to an existing platform.
michael mcginn -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
all right. appreciate the time. i'll pass along.
operator
the next question comes from ryan merkel of william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone, and nice quarter.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, ryan, good morning.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
so my first question is on operating leverage, which had a strong result this quarter. and obviously, the guide is first step up. and really my question, erik, is how confident can we be that this is a structural step up? have you seen enough from mission critical at this point?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. ryan, i do think we're comfortable that there's a definite structural element of the improvement. we're gosh, i guess about halfway through mission critical at this point. we've been executing on projects really across the cell space operations, the core g&a function of the business, and really quite pleased with what we've seen there and the ability to sustain those savings.
i definitely think we get some help in the second half from the growth rate of course, we're seeing favorable pricing that supports improved leverage. but at the end of the day, if we think back to our commitments around mission critical, it's even greater than 100 million of cost out. really happy with how that's been going and the ability to sustain that progress.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's great to hear. and then secondly on gross margin, i guess a two-parter. what are you hearing from suppliers? might you see another price increase here sooner than later? and then also typically in an inflationary environment, you'd see inventory profits, right, you're using your balance sheet.
are we going to see some benefit from that in the second half this year?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. on the first part of your question, ryan, i -- we're definitely still seeing movement on inflation from vendors. i'd say, we'll react to that if needed. in terms of what the timing or amount of that would look like, that will all be dependent on what we see coming from our vendors, our supplier base.
but obviously, inflation remains a big concern in the business. and then the second part of the question on inventory, just to clarify were you saying where we see a reduction in inventory? or a continued increase in inventory because of the supply chain challenges? just want to clarify your question.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. now more that you'd see a gross margin list because you've got inventory at a lower cost and you've had a price increase in the market. right. if i go back, look, 2011, we had an inflationary environment, right.
msc's putting up 30% plus incremental margins with gross margin help. just wondering if that's going to help second half this year if something's changed?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we've done a little bit of strategic purchasing ahead of cost increases, but not a significant amount. if you're thinking about how about margins for the second half of the year, what i -- what i'd share is, obviously in second quarter, we took the price increase in late january, which is mid-to-high single digits. that largely benefited february.
we had some progress before that, as erik alluded too, around the countermeasure. so i'd expect that gross margin for the third quarter, probably a slight sequential improvement as we get the full quarter of price realization. but what's also happening that mitigates some of that is because of the way our cost curve works on the average cost for the increased cost coming in, i'd say for fourth quarter, you can probably -- expect the sequential decline that looks somewhat in line with what our historical q3 to q4 sequential gross margin decrease would look like. so there's a lot of moving parts there in gross margin.
we're of course -- we're looking at what's happening with supplier rebates too, but the biggest drivers influencing second half gross margins are by far the impact of that january increase and then the continued roll on for the p&l of the cost increases through the average cost pricing method.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
ryan, the one other thing i'd add in is, look, i think you're seeing right now, if you're thinking back to prioritize the benefit of using the balance sheet, if you will, of taking price ahead of course you're seeing it now. so -- we're seeing positive price costs now. so if you if you think about the key elements of our growth and what's driving growth right now, some of those still mix us down. it's not like those have gone away.
if you think about implants and vending, we are getting benefits from price costs.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thanks for the color. pass it on.
operator
the next question comes from chris dankert of loop capital. please go ahead.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hey, morning. thanks for taking my question. i guess, looking at the few associate stats here, looked pretty static compared to what we saw last quarter. i guess any comment, is labor availability an issue here or is this more a strategic, ""hey, we're happy with where the head counts at and we're actively not adding."" just any -- any comments on labor and where we're at here?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. chris, so our goal for the year was to growth somewhere in the low single-digit range for field sales headcount. so in general, we're tracking there if you combine q1, q2, but if you asked me, is q2 have been affected by labor? the tight labor markets, the answer would be yes. ideally, we'd be a little bit ahead of that in the low single-digit range.
so we still feel like we'll be on track for the year low single-digit range, but hard not to be affected right now by the tight labor markets for sure.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. make sense. thanks for the color there. and then again, if i remember correctly, we were rolling out some new robotics at harrisburg and elkhart.
any comment on how those upgrades or new investments are going?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. -- we're really pleased with how those projects have come online. and i think i couldn't be more appreciative of having them given what is happening with the labor environment. we're seeing nice productivity driven by those projects.
and of course, always looking at what additional investments we can make in port automation more broadly in those facilities and in our other facilities.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks so much, and congrats on a nice quarter, guys.
operator
the next question comes from ken newman of keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the question.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, ken. -- good morning.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
morning. 
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
morning. i just wanted to circle back to some of the operating leverage questions that were asked earlier, and just thinking of it in a different way. if we think about the mission critical savings coming through, do you think you can start to drive operating margin higher than 12% if revenue comes in at mid-single digit in the future?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. mid-single digit revenue growth, to your question was, can we drive operating margins higher than 12% on mid-single digit growth? 
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. in the future, right? like -- understanding the framework for '22.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so looking -- looking ahead like really past this year, i think that would be the hope -- would be that we can be above the 12 on a mid-single-digit growth scenario. if we're -- thinking about this year, specifically with the annual operating margin framework, the mid-single digit growth scenario, tough to see a path to above 12 in fiscal '22 is mid-single digit growth scenario, just to clarify.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. yeah. and then just switching over. curious if you just provide some color in how you view the sales momentum between manufacturing and non-manufacturing as we enter into the second half, obviously we're going to be starting to lap the tougher comps in the government business next quarter with some tougher comps on the manufacturing side.
so any idea how we should think about the run rate growth beginning in the third quarter for those two customer segments?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think in general, ken, from --  look, first of all from a sequential average daily sales basis, we should see things. we would expect to see things build. yeah, you're right.
the comps are going to play around for sure with percentage of sales and what grows faster. so like particularly as you get past q3 [audio gap] public sector stuff kicks in, some of -- the new winds kick in and you lap the comps, it would -- i certainly expect that for an example, by q4 to have really strong growth. so on a relative basis, that probably picks up. but yeah, as of now, pretty much our outlook is positive on pretty much all -- we call that like automotive being an exception for obvious reasons.
but, the outlook is pretty positive across the board right now.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yep. and if you don't mind, i'll ask just one more and i'll get back in line. but i'm curious if you just remind us how much freight expenses represent as a percentage of sales and how much of those costs do you think are able -- you're able to contractually pass through? obviously, you've gotten pretty good realization on price, and i'm just trying to get a better sense of what's embedded in the margin guidance from, what's been a pretty volatile fuel environment most recently.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. so our freight out percent of sales is about 4%, a little more than 4%. we are actually pretty pleased with how we've been managing that, considering what's been happening in the inflationary environment around freight.
we were pretty well protected with our small parcel contract, seen a bit more inflation on our ltl contracts and definitely not immune from some of the surcharges that i'm sure you're hearing a lot about in the market. but generally, navigating that well and haven't seen a huge change in our freight percent of sales, given everything that's been happening in the environment. maybe, maybe a little bit more risk coming in here in the second half. but we -- we're hearing, of course, a lot of chatter from our carriers, -- fuel prices are absolutely impacting them.
so i'm expecting a bit more pressure here in the second half and potentially even in 2023, depending on how long this lasts. but generally, feeling pretty good about how our freight expenses have been playing out today.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for the color.

good morning, and welcome to the msc industrial supply 2022 fiscal second quarter results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead.
john chironna -- vice president, investor relations and treasurer
thank you, andrea, and good morning to everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me today. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on our investor relations web page. let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation.
our comments on this call, as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the impact of covid-19 on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition, expected future results, and expected benefits from our investment in strategic plans and other initiatives. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors in the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec as well as in other sec filings.
these risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid-19. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements except as required by applicable law. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures.
please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation or on our website, which contain the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik.  
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. good morning, and thanks for joining us today. i hope that everyone remains safe and healthy. as we cross the halfway point of our fiscal 2022, i'm excited by the growing momentum inside of our company to accelerate market share capture and improve profitability.
each passing quarter is another proof point that the extensive repositioning of msc is now firmly taking hold. as our performance improves, we continue raising the bar on expectations across the organization. and i'm pleased to see how our team is rising to the challenge. with respect to market share capture, we're sustaining growth rates that are at or above our long range target of growth, at least 400 basis points above the industrial production index.
our fiscal second quarter average daily sales growth rate of 7.9%, does not do justice to the momentum that we see developing. this year included two sales days around the holidays that carried minimal sales, whereas last year we were closed due to the timing of those days. therefore, the absolute sales growth rate of 11.4% is more indicative of underlying performance. january got off to a very slow start, as a result of widespread absenteeism due to the covid surge throughout the supply chain.
in fact, our growth rate in january actually started out negative. we saw an inflection during the last two weeks of the month of january, and we've sustained double-digit growth rates since that point. february was particularly strong at nearly 18%, with a catch up from the soft january. and march has continued our double-digit growth pace.
you'll hear from kristen that we now see double-digit growth for fiscal '22 as a likely outcome. in line with our strategy, growth is being fueled by the five growth levers that we've been describing for you. and those are metalworking, solutions, selling the portfolio, digital investments, and customer diversification with an emphasis on the public sector. within these five levers, today i'll highlight our implant program, e-commerce, metalworking, and the public sector.
implant continues its strong momentum and now represents approximately 9% of company sales. we're tracking ahead of plan, which targeted 10% of total company sales by the end of fiscal '23. our recent investments in e-commerce are also starting to pay dividends. e-commerce reached 60.7% of total company sales, up 150 basis points from prior year and 30 basis points from the prior quarter.
this is being driven largely by improvements to mscdirect.com. our technical metalworking expertise, including msc millmax, is particularly powerful in the current environment. our customers are experiencing rapid inflation, labor shortages, extended lead times and more. as a result, the need for productivity on the plant floor is higher now than it's ever been.
and msc is uniquely positioned to address these challenges, as the largest national metalworking distributor offering multiple brands, robust technical expertise, and the ability to document cost savings and productivity improvements on a continuous basis. a recent example demonstrates how our approach is helping customers find the needed productivity. our technical experts were brought into one of our aerospace customers to analyze their cutting tool consumption. we were able to save the customer over $1.2 million on an annualized basis, by recommending alternate tooling that yielded faster metal removal rates, shorter lead times, and increased productivity with a more cost effective tool.
these savings are allowing our customer to bring some of the outsourced production back in-house, adding volume for our customer, and leading to greater opportunities for msc. examples like these are happening regularly across our business and they are fueling new customer wins as well as greater wallet share at existing customers. finally on the growth front is the public sector. our team is performing well.
you may have seen that we were recently awarded a five year contract to service 10 u.s. marine corps bases across the continental united states, hawaii, and japan. implementation across the bases is underway, and we expect to see revenue build through the balance of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23. turning now to profitability improvements.
our long range goal is to -- restore return on invested capital into the high teens by the end of fiscal '23. and we said we would achieve this by leveraging growth, by executing on gross margin initiatives, and by delivering structural cost takeout of at least $100 million, helping to reduce opex as a percentage of sales by at least 200 basis points from our fiscal 2019 baseline. i'm encouraged by progress on each of these fronts. let me start out with a few words about gross margin.
you'll recall that we were not pleased with our gross margin performance in our fiscal first quarter. we began addressing it aggressively with countermeasures during the latter portion of q1. as part of those countermeasures and in response to the massive purchase cost inflation coming from our suppliers, we implemented a significant price increase in late january. price realization thus far has been strong, and as a result, q2 gross margins came in at 42.5%.
this gives us added confidence that we can keep gross margins flat or better for fiscal '22 versus prior year. we also generated strong operating expense leverage and reduced adjusted opex as a percentage of sales by 80 basis points versus prior year. this is largely the result of our mission critical initiative. we delivered $6 million of savings in the second quarter and remain on track for $25 million in expected cost savings for the fiscal year.
and we remain on pace to achieve our goal of at least $100 million in total cost savings by the end of fiscal '23. all of this is translating into improving adjusted returns on capital, which is well on its way into the high teens. turning now to the external landscape. the story remains largely unchanged.
strong underlying demand, tight supply chain constraints, even tighter labor constraints, and rapid inflation. all of this is evidenced in public indices such as ip readings, which remain at mid-single digit growth levels. sentiment surveys like the mbi and feedback from our customers. [audio gap] with limited exceptions like automotive, the order backlog and outlook for most customer segments remains robust.
relative to last quarter, headwinds from covid have eased dramatically. they reached a fever pitch during december and the first half of january. but if subsided considerably as the virus has waned. like everyone will watch the developments with the latest variant, of course.
here at msc, we reopened our customer support centers in melville and davidson, with a hybrid work environment. we've received positive feedback from our associates and our operations are running smoothly. angst related to covid has been joined by broad based concerns related to the russia-ukraine situation. our direct exposure to the region with respect to sales and purchasing is insignificant.
the indirect impacts, though, will likely play out in the form of further inflation, and more supply chain disruption. while these conditions create some challenges for us here at msc, they also provide opportunities to take additional market share from the 70% of the distribution market that's made up of local and regional distributors. msc's brought in deep inventory, a good better best brand assortment, and our logistics capabilities, enable us to service our customers at high levels when many cannot. we've used recent market conditions to accelerate share capture and will continue doing so.
kristen will now take you through the details of our performance, the financials for the quarter and our outlook, which includes a revised annual operating margin framework with a low double-digit sales growth scenario. kristen, over to you.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, eric. i'll begin on slide 4 of our presentation where you can see key metrics for the fiscal second quarter on a reported basis. slide 5 reflects the adjusted results, which will be my primary focus for this morning. our second quarter sales came in at $863 million.
as erik mentioned, given the extra two days this year coming with minimal sales, the total sales growth of 11.4% over the prior year period is more reflective of our real growth. on an average daily sales basis, q2 growth was 7.9%. our non-safety and non-janitorial product lines grew just over 10% on an ads basis, and sales of safety and janitorial products declined roughly 3%. looking at ads growth rates for our sales by customer type.
government sales declined roughly 11%, due to the difficult janitorial and safety comps. this is a large improvement from q1's decline of nearly 30%, and we expect the comps to ease further in the back half of fiscal 2022. national account growth with low double-digit and core customers grew high single-digit. we're continuing to see strong execution and growth initiatives with vending and plant and mscdirect.com, each growing roughly 100 basis points or more, as a percent of total company sales versus the prior year.
as erik mentioned, our fiscal q2 gross margin was 42.5%, up 90 basis points sequentially from our first quarter, and up 440 basis points from last year's fiscal q2. as you may recall included in last year's q2 gross margin was a $30 million ppe related write down. excluding this write down, our prior year q2 adjusted gross margin was 42%, 50 basis points below the current year quarter. we're very pleased with this result and we remain on track to hold the annual gross margin for fiscal year 2022 flat or better in fiscal 2021.
reported and adjusted operating expenses in the second quarter were $266 million, or 30.8% of sales. last year reported operating expenses were $245.1 million, and adjusted operating expenses were $244.4, or 31.6% of sales. this represents an 80 basis point reduction in adjusted opex to sales. it's worth noting that this includes an increase to our incentive compensation accrual this quarter, including a year-to-date catch up that will not repeat.
we incurred approximately $3.1 million of restructuring and other costs in the quarter, as compared to $21.6 million in the prior year quarter. last year's q2 charges primarily included operating lease impairment, and other related costs associated with our move from physical sales branches to virtual customer care hubs. our operating margin was 11.3%, compared to 3.6% in the same period last year. excluding the restructuring and other costs and the ppe related inventory write down in the prior year, our adjusted operating margin was 11.6% versus an adjusted 10.4% in the prior year period, a 120 basis point improvement.
on the adjusted incremental margin front for second quarter came in at just over 22% ahead of our initial fiscal 2022 goal. earnings per share were $1.25 as compared to $0.32 in the same period prior year. adjusted for restructuring and other costs, as well as the prior year's ppe related inventory write down. adjusted earnings per share were $1.29 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of a $1.03 in the prior year period, an increase of 25%.
this is a result of our execution at all levels, sales performance, gross margin, and opex leverage. turning to the balance sheet, you can see that as of the end of our fiscal second quarter, we were carrying $658 million of inventory, up $35 million from q1 balance of $623 million. the inventory build is fairly typical with historical periods of high growth, with the added element of ongoing supply chain disruptions. accounts receivable are also rising as expected with the current sales growth.
as a result of this increased use of working capital, our second quarter cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income was slightly negative. our capital expenditures were $16 million in the second quarter. moving ahead to slide 7, you can see the uses of working capital also impacts our free cash flow, which came in slightly negative for the second quarter as compared to $4 million in the prior year quarter. we do expect cash conversion to improve in the second half of fiscal 2022, and for the fiscal 2022 full year to come in at approximately 70% to 80%, roughly comparable with historical periods of southwest.
our current expectation for strong sales growth for the year, continuing supply chain challenges, and the recent government contract win are all increasing our working capital and affecting our cash conversion for this year. our total debt at the end of the fiscal second quarter was $835 million, which reflects a $72 million increase from our first quarter. as for the composition of our debt, $285 million was on our revolving credit facility, about $200 million was under our uncommitted facilities, approximately $300 million with long-term fixed rate borrowings, and $50 million were short-term fixed rate borrowings. our cash and cash equivalents were $42 million, resulting in net debt of $794 million at the end of the quarter, up from $700 million at the end of the first quarter.
let me now provide an update on our mission critical productivity goals. you may recall that our updated cost savings goal for fiscal 2023 is a minimum of $100 million versus our fiscal 2019 cost base. as you can see on slide 8, our cumulative savings for fiscal 2021 were $60 million, and we also invested roughly $22 million over that same period. for the full year fiscal 2022, we expect additional gross savings of $25 million, and additional investments of $15 million.
we've made excellent progress toward this goal in the first half, as we've achieved $16 million of gross savings and invested $11 million. we remain on target to hit at least $100 million of cost savings by fiscal 2023. before i turn it back to erik, let me share a few comments on the back half of the year. we're encouraged by the momentum building across all three lines of the p&l, revenue growth, gross margins, and operating expense leverage.
our current growth momentum creates the potential for a higher tier on our annual operating margin framework provided to you on slide 9. you can see that we added a low double-digit scenario in that growth range. we would achieve an annual adjusted operating margin between 12.5% and 13.1%. should the current trends continue, we would expect to move into that range.
at those levels of adjusted operating margin, our incremental margins will be around 25% in the back half of this year and north of the 20%, we originally envisioned for full year fiscal 2022. and i'll now turn it back over to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. we've now crossed the halfway point of fiscal '22 and momentum is picking up steam. with each passing quarter, our repositioning is taking hold. we're accelerating market share capture, capitalizing on our ability to add value in a unique pricing environment in order to improve gross margins, and we're generating operating leverage through our mission critical efforts.
as we look to the back half of the year, we will continue raising the bar, targeting double-digit sales growth, strong price realization, and incremental margins in the mid-20s. before closing, i'd like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of our team. they are the driving force behind our improved performance for all stakeholders. all 6,500 of us will remain restless until we achieve our mission to be the best industrial distributor in the world.
thank you, and will now open up the line for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] this first question comes from tommy moll with stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, tommy. good morning. how are you?
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
doing well. thanks. i had planned to ask if you had seen any sign of a slowdown in the business, but now having erik and kristen on the record that you're not, i will -- instead of asking a third time, i'll go a different direction and ask, have you seen anything changed? so compared to last quarter when we had this conversation, have any of your end markets gotten better or worse? has the positions with customers changed at all? you highlighted, erik, some [audio gap] fatigue. maybe that's a little bit different.
anything that's changed would be helpful.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
tommy, i would say that for the most part, most of the factors you just referenced, so demand outlook, inflation, the shortages, the lead times, are fairly similar to last quarter. i think in some ways, the change is that these headwinds that our customers and suppliers are feeling continue. and i think what that's doing is just sharpening the focus on need for productivity and need for help in our customers. there is a drumbeat for sure about, hey, we understand price increases.
they're coming fast and furious from every line of the p&l. we need help offsetting them with productivity. we need help offsetting the labor shortages we're facing, which have not abated either. and there is still -- despite some of the headlines on supply chains easing, there's still real shortages and lead time delays, so we need products.
so i think all of those are playing well into our favor because we can deliver on some of those things for customers. but i think it's more or less a lot of the same things that are just kind of sharpening this need for the customer.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
following up on mission critical, you're ahead of plan currently. so if we think this through, as it continues to evolve, do you end up with a more run rate repeatable kind of operating framework? i mean, mission critical was a very specific plan for a very specific starting point. but do we evolve into a more [audio gap] process [audio gap] and if the answer is yes, [audio gap] any of the contours, is there an implied incremental that you end up in? hypothetically, if you have an operating in production grows low single digits in a given year, is there a rough range for [audio gap]
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes, i'll break it down in a few parts. so i think first part of your question on mission critical. so we've got the official sort of originally stated mission critical goals ending in fiscal '23. and that's the guidance that we gave back in kind of the beginning of this journey where we're going to deliver greater than $100 million of cost savings.
so absolutely on track to meet and exceed that target. so you can kind of assume at least $15 million more of savings in '23 to kind of bring us across the finish line for the originally stated mission critical goals. but then to your point, it's not really going to end in '23. what mission critical is ultimately about is kind of changing the culture, changing the mindset in the company to generate continuous productivity.
how much productivity, i think you kind of asked how to think about that in the context of a framework. i'd say a lot of it has to do with how much we think we need to offset in terms of what's coming at us from an inflationary perspective and also how much do we want to be able to invest every year. so no specific guidance at this point beyond '22. we'll give a little more color on our fiscal '23 framework that will come up next quarter.
and at that point, hopefully, we'll have a little bit more of an understanding what might be coming at us from a macroeconomic perspective. but generally, we feel really well poised for next year. we're on track for all the mission critical targets, not just the cost-out target. so i feel very confident about continuing to grow at least 400 basis points above ip.
we feel very good about delivering the opex savings, and we're already on track and ahead of schedule on the roic improvement. so feeling very good about where we are to close out '22 and right now, feeling optimistic about '23.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
stay tuned and i'll turn it back for now.

thank you. and our next question today comes from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. nice quarter. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, ry. good morning. 
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
so my first question was on inflation. i'm curious, do you think prices are starting to peak here or is that not clear yet?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
ryan, i would say, not clear yet. certainly, to date, we continue to see -- we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we took an increase as recently as late in may in response to what we're seeing from suppliers. so i would say we have not yet seen a slowdown in the rate and pace of increases coming from our suppliers with, ryan, as you know, is sort of for us the leading indicator. and i think that's because this inflation wave is driven beyond just commodities.
it's driven by so many other factors, oil and fuel, wage rates and what's going on. there's multiple variables here. so, so far, no slowdown.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok, that's kind of what i thought you'd say. and then turning to gross margin. how much did price cost help gross margin in the quarter, the increase here, you're up 60 bps?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so year over year, the way to think about the margin improvement of 60 bps is i'd attribute about half of it to favorable price offsetting purchase cost inflation and any mix headwind and then about the other half from increased vendor rebates.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. so i'm just trying to get a sense for this year how much price cost is helping your gross margin. could you help us there? and should we view that as onetime because cogs will eventually catch up, so there might be a little give back as we look out into '23? is that the right framework?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
let me take you maybe q3 to q4, so you can kind of cap how to think about fiscal '22. so if you're thinking about sequential gross margin from q3 to q4, the first thing i'd tell you is you've got to account for the seasonal mix headwind that we typically see at this time of year, and it has to do with the product mix of summer goods. so think about 50 to 60 basis points roughly of headwind from that dynamic. then you've got pricing, which we do expect to remain positive.
we'll get a little bit of a boost from that small may increase that we took. but then you have offsetting that increased purchase cost inflation and a decrease sequentially in vendor rebates. and so that's kind of the organic q3 to q4 changes. and then on top of that, i would layer in a headwind from engman-taylor, about 30 basis points approximately.
and for '23, i'd say too early right now to guide, ryan. i mean, like erik just commented, we don't know what's going on with inflation yet. and really of all the variables that we're looking at to understand how fiscal '23 might shake out, price cost is definitely one of the biggest ones, and much of that is contingent on what happens with the timing of the inflation cycle.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. no, that all makes sense. and i was really just trying to get a sense. my feeling is price has helped the business, but not maybe as much as we've seen in the past.
so is that the right -- it's been sort of a modest boost, not something that was overly impactful to gross margins.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
well, i think organically, if you think about being able to improve margins, fiscal '22 versus fiscal '21, so we're going a few years now actually with keeping flat or slightly up margins. and that is a change in trajectory from what we've seen the business do in the last several years. and to be able to do that, it basically means we're getting enough of a favorable spread from price cost that it offsets that mix headwind that we've kind of been seeing in the business steadily over the past several years as some of our growth initiatives, which are margin headwinds, as those continue to grow. so we're getting enough price cost that it's covering that mix headwind.
so in that regard, i would say we do feel really good about the price contribution of the business. i don't know how far back you have to go to really see price maybe doing better than that. i don't know if erik wants to add any context from the kind of era before i got here. but we're really pleased with the price cost outcome.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
i think the only other thing i'd add, ryan, is this time around, there is, look, obviously, we're benefiting from a macro environment, the inflation that's out of our control. but i would say relative to past cycles, there is more work going on in the company to control our destiny. so we've talked about there's a big pricing initiative inside the company to sort of build up the muscle in our sales organization on how to have that discussion with customers and how to sell through price. so that even if, at some point, inflation is going to slow how do we still make sure we're extracting value, because we are delivering the goods for the customer in terms of productivity and product availability.
so that's one initiative. ccsg, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's getting amped-up focus under kim and team in the field, that is a margin-accretive piece of our business that we're starting to see momentum. there's focus going on, on private brands inside the company and moving the mix of business there. so there are things on the self-help front, i think probably more so than i would have said during the past pricing cycle, ryan.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
very helpful. thank you. pass it on.

and our next question today comes from david manthey of baird. please go ahead.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
well, thank you. good morning, everyone. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, dave.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
i was wondering if you could give us some insight into your thinking as you're developing the fiscal '23 framework potentially. i know you're not going to give us details, but is the plan, regardless of what you see out in the market, you'll have a category for sales declines? or will you just base the buckets on how you're budgeting and then adjust later if conditions change, like you did with the upside this year.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i should say i think it's high, queen. not high in.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
no, that's dave.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
it's dave.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
dave, it doesn't sound like you. so fiscal '23 framework, dave, a couple of thoughts. we're obviously going to be modeling a lot of scenarios. there's a lot of uncertainty out there right now.
we talked a little bit about what happens with the inflationary cycle and price cost being one of the biggest factors that could move the needle for us in '23. but generally, we're trying to understand what is going to happen with the industrial production index, being representative of what we would say is market growth. and then what's our ability to gain share and take price on top of that. so that's like some of the really big buckets that we're modeling and thinking through.
and we have a lot of positive momentum heading into '23 that we feel really good about allowing us to capture share, regardless of what happens to the market. so we're very focused on controlling our own destiny and delivering that at least 400 basis points of growth above ip, regardless of what the ip index actually does. and obviously, if we were to head into a down scenario, some of our ability to continue expanding margin gets a little bit harder than if we get some favorable ip growth. but generally, again, very optimistic right now with what we see the momentum in the business and definitely committing to hitting those mission critical goals for '23, regardless of the circumstances.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. so it sounds like you'll base the buckets on some outlook for ip and then adjust from there is sort of the view.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. yeah, big building blocks, ip is a benchmark for market. what do we think is going to happen on price cost, share gain and then productivity and inflation.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. ok, great. and then as it relates to mission critical and some of these cost savings, in a recent general investor deck, you cited that you still have 26 branch locations. and i'm wondering, does that number gravitate to 0 over time? and if not, could you talk about why? if so, could you talk about the time frame? and then if the savings from those closures is included in your mission critical targets.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yes. so dave, the 26 now is -- we feel pretty good about that number. we would imagine that stays stable. obviously, we did a lot of big work around the branch restructuring last year, which took out many of our branches.
the ones that are left behind are really supporting some of the different kind of businesses within msc. and we feel like 26 is the right number. so not contemplating any more savings from any kind of material branch restructuring or branch closures.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
perfect. all right. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from chris dankert with loop capital. please go ahead.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking the question.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
i guess you mentioned there's ongoing lead time extension, supply chain issues kind of continuing a pace here. i guess how do we translate that for msc? kind of what's the fill rate today look like versus that near-98% level we were seeing kind of pre-pandemic?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
chris, what i would say is there's definitely still supply chain issues. we're seeing a difference in our -- compared to sort of pre-covid fill rates, but the difference for us is very marginal. whereas compared to the local distributors, it's a really wide gap between pre-pandemic and now. so we actually feel in some ways like on a relative basis, the advantage has grown.
although yes, when we look at our fill rate and our service metrics, chris, you could see the difference. we're still not back. we're up from where we were at the lows a few quarters ago, but still not back to pre-pandemic. i will point out one nuance, which is we look at it a couple of different ways, what we call first pass and second pass.
so first pass would be, is the product located in the location that's closest to the customer? and there, we see a pretty sizable difference. the second metric would be second pass, which is do we have the item anywhere in our network? and for that second pass measure, the difference is very marginal. and this has been the case through covid. so while there's some freight expense to be borne by moving things around, we're generally, more often than not, able to deliver for the customer.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
got it. and that's certainly been such an issue, having product on hand in terms of market share conversion. so glad to hit that, that kind of continues to recover. we're not quite there yet.
and then just kind of a point of clarification. i didn't see it in the deck. in-plant growth in the quarter, i assume that's still kind of 9% of total sales. we're still seeing near 70% growth in that business today?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
it's approaching 10% of sales actually this quarter.
chris dankert -- loop capital markets -- analyst
perfect. well, thank you so much guys. really appreciate the color.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. no problem.
operator
and our next question today comes from hamzah mazari with jefferies. please go ahead.
hans hoffman -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. this is hans hoffman filling in for hamzah mazari. i know you guys touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks, but could you just talk about what you're seeing in metalworking markets from a growth perspective? and then just maybe talk about some of the competitive dynamics there?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so in terms of end markets, the general comment i would say is we're seeing pretty much broad-based strength across most of the verticals that are metalworking-related. certainly, you can imagine with oil prices being high, that area of the business is doing a lot better than it was years ago. auto and aero are certainly on their way back and growing, and we still feel like there's plenty of room in both of those general machining strong.
so environment is good. and then in terms of competitive dynamic, metalworking, it's a lot like the rest of the industrial supplies in the mro market space, which is that it's highly fragmented. so you think about it across -- this is now beyond metalworking, but across the entire industrial landscape, the top 50 distributors have roughly 30% share. the metalworking would sort of be an analog to that.
and so it's fragmented, and there's a lot of market share to be had from local and regional distributors that aren't faring quite as well right now.
hans hoffman -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. and i know you guys -- you mentioned the engman-taylor acquisition, but could you just talk about your m&a pipeline going forward? and if you're seeing any changes to private company valuations? and then how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so on the m&a front, i would say in terms of our outlook, and we've been pretty consistent for a while now, which is that particularly as it relates to anything really big and really sort of outside of our core business, the bar would have to be really high, that we are focused on a pipeline within our core business here. and we have a couple of things that we consider to be in our core. the one change i'd call out is it does feel like the pipeline and the degree of conversations are more robust.
i think there's probably a lot of private owners just thinking about life, about the future of the business, etc. so i think the pipeline is pretty robust. again, they would be of the more or less of the smaller variety inside of our core. i mean, engman-taylor is a great example.
it's a great team. it's in an msa where we'd like to see more penetration. they've been a leading competitor for a long time. the values line up between rick and msc.
so a great example of what we would hope to find and continue to build on. in terms of capital allocation, look, we're sitting now at about one and a half times leverage, which is a very comfortable place to be, particularly as kristen had mentioned, we would expect to start to see cash generation really picking up as working capital kind of stabilizes. so we think we have plenty of dry powder here. we're going to stay pretty disciplined.
first priorities for us are organic reinvestment into the business to the extent we like what we see in terms of the return prospects. and of late, our confidence is really building based on the performance. close second would be the ordinary dividend. and then from there, we look at m&a, we'll look at return of cash to shareholders, i.e., buyback on a risk-adjusted basis.
and the only other comment i'll make is we are mindful of rising interest rates. so from our standpoint, in a high interest rate environment, it doesn't change anything other than that the hurdle rate effectively goes up if we're going to deploy cash.
hans hoffman -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thanks. i'll turn it back over now.

thank you,. and our next question today comes from ken newman at keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. so first question, erik, i appreciate the comments about the macro uncertainty and your ability to adjust quickly if the environment changes. we've talked a little bit about -- i think there was an earlier question about what structural incremental margins could look like, just given all the work you've done in mission critical. but i'm also curious if you have a viewpoint on what structural decrementals could look like relative to past down cycles.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
ken, i can take that one. so at this point, we're not even modeling a scenario where we need to worry about decrementals for next year. if things were to really erode before we give the framework for '23, we would provide some guidance on that. but right now, it's not something that we're even looking at.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
but i guess to the point, though, you would expect that even in a downturn, an eventual downturn in the cycle, you'd expect those decrementals to be better than what you've experienced in the past, right? just given on a structural cost out over the last two or three years.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, absolutely. yeah, i think that's where we'll really see a benefit from all the mission-critical work that's been done over the last couple of years already in terms of structural cost takeout. we're at $85 million roughly at the end of -- as of the end of this year approximately. that will certainly help us.
and then erik also mentioned before, just a lot of things that we're doing differently inside the business now that are going to allow us to weather that storm differently than msc has in the past. so i think a big one that we're really excited about erik brought up earlier, but just the work we've been doing around capability development in the field, things that benefit our ability to add value to the customer kind of regardless of what the macro environment is. that would definitely make a down cycle look quite different for us than it has in the past.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
is there any way that you can maybe just provide just a little bit more color as to maybe give us a framework of if decrementals were -- making up a number here, in the 20%, is it more of like a mid-teen type of range? or is that you're still kind of doing work on that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
we'll give you a look at that next quarter.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then for my follow-up here. i know inflation is still a very real impact on the market today. and obviously, you're already putting in some price increases to address that here.
i do think we've seen some pullback in raw material costs for some key materials though, like steel and copper. just any color on how you think about decisions on inventory? and how do you think about the potential price cost normalization when inflation does roll?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
ken, look, at some point, inflation -- obviously, we track commodities very carefully. and that is part of the buying formulas. we look, our buyers are tracking commodities and indexes. what i will say is, as i mentioned earlier, relative to prior cycles, there's other factors beyond just the commodities that are influencing our suppliers raising prices for now.
look, at some point, no question, the music will stop. and the inflation cycle, that could be next quarter, it could be next year, it could be in three years, five years. we have no idea. at some point, that will stop.
and certainly, price cost will come under more pressure than it is now. and look, i think it's why one of the comments we made earlier was we're focused on initiatives in our control, that even in an environment where we're not capturing as much in price, that we have the ability to offset more pressure on price cost through our own initiatives. and i mentioned a few of those earlier.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. appreciate the time.

good morning. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, pat. good morning. thank you.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. how are you doing, erik? just a first question is on price. when you look in the fourth quarter, i think you said you put through late may increase. i'm just curious what do you expect that price contribution to be to sales? will it be up from the 6% you just put up in the third quarter given that increase? and then as you look into next year, what's the carryover now based on kind of what you've announced? and then i'm sorry, this is kind of a little bit of a long question, just along those lines, as you think about next year, is there some bucket of your product offering that could see pricing move down to that last question if commodities deflate from here? or is all of that price you put through considered by you to be kind of sticky such that you wouldn't give any of that back in that scenario? sorry for the long question.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good. good. ok, so it's like an abc, so let me start off with the -- we'll go  near term, how about -- so near term, your first question, pat, was about q4. look, so you could do the math on.
and what we show in the op stats, we give you a sense of price. and we always call it price mix because it's tough to decouple the two all the time, but it's in that growth decomposition. and in our q3, i think it was in the five, five and a half percent. something like that range.
where does it go for q4? it's hard to predict precisely because mix does play into it. this is sort of a living organism here and things change. but that being said, all else being equal, sure, yes, we took -- so the increase we took in late may was low single digit. so it's not like it was huge.
but yes, if realization does what we think it should do, one would expect the price contribution in q4 to be -- all else being equal, slightly higher than it was in q3. that's right. so i think that was the first part of your question. the second part is the carryover.
i think the way to think about that is we will get a part of the year. so for the larger increase we took in january, we are going to get that for the first sort of carry over the first part of fiscal '23. and then for the late may increase, we will get a carryover for roughly three-quarters of fiscal '23. and then, of course, the other contribution would be any additional price increases that happen, which will be a function of what we see between now and september or, quite frankly, through the course of fiscal '23.
i think that was the second one. the third one was about deflation. and certainly, commodities are going to come down. i will say, pat, and you never say never, right? but if i look back over the course of my history in this industry, because the finished goods, the parts that we sell, the raw materials generally are a relatively small percentage of the finished product.
we have not really seen cases where deflation leads to mass price reductions, which is to say, generally, pricing is sticky. i think what certainly would happen is if prices commodities come down, the prospect of further price increases goes away. but it would be unlikely. and certainly, it would be a break in pattern from the past to see prices in mass come down.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. that's helpful color. thanks for accommodating all of those questions. i have one follow-up and then this one is on gross margin.
i guess what surprised you in the quarter? it just seemed to me like sales were kind of in line with how you thought they would play out in the quarter. so i guess i'm curious why did volume rebates come in as it -- well, maybe you had -- maybe that was planned to be where it was. i guess that's the question. what surprised you? because you call out price cost, you call volume rebates, but i feel like the gross margin was better sequentially than maybe internally or maybe externally people thought maybe internally as well.
just curious what surprised you. and then i think you said at one point recently, you saw enough momentum that gross margins could be flat next year. i may have that wrong. if i'm wrong, just tell me you never said that.
if i'm right, i guess, i'm just curious, is that still the case?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
so pat, i can take the first part. i sort of start, and then i'll turn it over to kristen,. that's good. i think what surprises, look, i think if you go back, we were thinking at the time last quarter, we were coming off of a strong sequential lift from q1 to q2.
we felt good about that. and we felt like, hey, gross margin should be up a little bit from q2 to q3, but not a lot. so i would say you are correct. the 40 bps was a little more, probably a little more than we expected.
i'd say two things. one is, look, i mentioned we have this initiative in the field on pricing to improve realization. the results have been quite good. so i think that's one.
and then two is, yes, look, we did a heavy amount of purchasing. that resulted in outsized rebates. and to some degree, we expected it, but we probably did even a little bit better there, is the two things i'd call out. and then the other point was about '23.
kristen, do you want to jump in?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. i don't believe we've commented on that specifically, pat. i think we're looking at a variety of potential outcomes for margin next year.
and obviously, the length of the inflation cycle would be a really big driver of the guidance we would provide for gross margins next year. but i'd say, given what we know of for '23, it would be a very good outcome if we were able to hold margins flat. there's certainly a set of conditions under which that could happen. but that would be a really good outcome for us for next year, i would say.
and we'll give some more guidance on some ranges and kind of what would affect that on the margin side when we head into the outlook for next year. but -- and your comment was specifically on gross margins to be clear, right, pat?
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, you got it. that's exactly right, yeah. that's what your answer was in response to, right?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. just checking. as i finished talking, i was like i got to make sure that was a gross margin question. yeah, that was gross margin answer.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. great. and i mean i have one little modeling one, too. just on the fourth quarter, you said opex to sales on that extra week is 20%.
what do you expect the extra week to carry for absolute sales contribution related to the extra week?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. just roughly, whatever you're modeling for q4 is whatever five days is worth. i just -- that's the easiest way doing it, then to supply 20% opex on that. typical gross margins.
pat baumann -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much. appreciate the time.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
no problem.

good day, and welcome to the msc industrial supply fiscal 2022 third quarter conference call. [operator instructions] please note, today's event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead, sir.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, and good morning, everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me today. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on our investor relations web page. let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation.
our comments on this call as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the high inflationary environment and global economic conditions on our operations, results of operations and financial condition, expected future results, expected benefits from our investment in strategic plans and other initiatives and expected future growth and profitability. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors and the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec as well as in our other sec filings.
these risk factors include our comments on the high inflationary environment and global economic conditions. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by applicable law. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures.
please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation or on our website, which contain the reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, john. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i hope you remain safe and healthy. on today's call, i'll reflect on our recent performance, provide color on q3 and also share our perspective on the current environment.
kristen will provide more specifics on our financial performance and outlook, and i'll then wrap things up before we open up the line for questions. we're now three-quarters of the way through fiscal 2022, and our drive to improve execution and financial performance is in full swing. each passing quarter is another proof point of progress on our mission-critical journey. during our fiscal third quarter, we achieved revenue growth of roughly 500 basis points above the ip index.
we demonstrated continued gross margin expansion, both sequentially and year over year. and we translated the growth into strong operating leverage. adjusted incremental margins for the quarter were just over 33%, and adjusted operating margins expanded 200 basis points. our fiscal third quarter represented the highest revenue in the history of our company and the lowest operating expense to sales ratio since fiscal 2013.
while we're encouraged with progress, we are far from satisfied. on the growth front, we're seeing historically high contribution from realized price in light of the inflationary environment. and so we still expect more growth above ip, and we're focused on capturing it. on the profitability front, operating margins are improving, but we strive for consistent margin expansion before we declare victory.
turning now to our performance, i'll begin with revenue growth. we remain focused on the same five growth levers that have had our attention all year and those are: metalworking, solutions, selling the portfolio, digital and customer diversification with an emphasis on the public sector. today, i'll highlight metalworking, selling the portfolio and the public sector. metalworking remains the cornerstone of our strategy.
we use our expertise to bring productivity and profit improvement to our customers. these efforts are driving customer satisfaction, new wins and the strong price realization rates that we've been seeing. a recent example underscores the power of our metalworking team. one of our experts recently consulted with a customer who produces machinery for the food processing and consumer goods industries.
we recommended numerous process improvements to both their drilling and milling operations. those recommendations reduced cycle times in milling in the customers milling operations from nearly three minutes down to just 10 seconds per part. similar improvements were made in their drilling operation, taking cycle times from over two minutes down to just 15 seconds. in total, this translated into increased capacity and reduced energy consumption, yielding $700,000 in annual profit improvement for the customer.
for msc, this has resulted in a severalfold increase in share of wallet. in order to bolster our metalworking leadership, we acquired engman-taylor, a premier metalworking distributor headquartered in wisconsin, after the quarter end. we have long admired the company and are excited about the combination of our two businesses. engman-taylor brings to msc a deep bench of metalworking expertise, a great reputation with customers and suppliers and a culture that aligns with ours.
ceo rick star will continue running the engman-taylor business, and i'm thrilled to welcome him and the entire team to msc. next, i'll touch on selling the portfolio, which is about cross-selling additional product lines, most notably, our c-parts consumable offering of ccsg. this business is particularly important because it solves a big challenge for our customers through an outsourced vmi model and, at the same time, creates high degrees of loyalty and stickiness for msc in a high-margin category. we have sharpened our focus on this business, and we're seeing performance improve as a result.
growth has been pacing ahead of company average with q3 coming in the mid-teens. we view this as the early stages of our plan, and we expect momentum to build. finally, on the growth front, i'll update on the public sector. while sales remained down in the quarter, i'm encouraged by progress.
during the course of q3, we completed implementation across the entirety of marine basis for the 4pl contract. we've begun to see revenues build, and we're on pace with our initial expectations. partially as a result of this, we saw the public sector inflect during the quarter. march and april were slightly under 20% negative, whereas may flipped to growth, and we expect double-digit growth in our fiscal fourth quarter.
turning to gross margin. i remain quite pleased with our performance. following a strong output in our fiscal q2, gross margins lifted sequentially another 40 basis points in q3. this is largely the result of the late january price increase and supplier rebate upside due to higher purchase volumes.
realization rates remain strong against the backdrop of severe inflation as our value proposition is resonating with customers during these extreme times. our customers are plagued with rapid inflation, labor shortages and extended lead times. the need for product availability and for tangible productivity gains are paramount. msc is delivering on both fronts as evidenced by the example i shared earlier.
i'll also mention that in response to continued supplier cost increases, we implemented a low single-digit price increase toward the end of may. finally, i'm particularly excited by our progress this quarter on operating profit improvement. thanks to our mission critical initiatives and to the efforts of our entire team on expense control and productivity gains, we reduced adjusted operating expense to sales ratio by 140 basis points and hence, expanded adjusted operating margins by 200 basis points. these efforts are pushing adjusted roic into the high teens, and we are ahead of schedule with our original 2023 goal.
turning to the external landscape. we are in interesting times indeed. on the one hand, there are several yellow or red macro indicators, such as high inflation, rising interest rates and ongoing supply chain shortages and challenges. on the other hand, we are experiencing a more encouraging picture.
order levels, backlogs and overall activity remain strong. most segments of the industrial economy are still seeing robust demand patterns as evidenced by the industrial production index. that said, many of our customers are feeling the effects of extreme inflation in all lines of their income statement, along with the ongoing labor and supply shortages, resulting in the need for productivity and process improvement. despite supply chain constraints easing gradually, we are nowhere near back to a normal environment.
and while all of this continues to put pressure on our customers, we are not seeing the evidence of an imminent recession that is suggested by the headlines. as a result, we remain in growth mode. in fact, we expect double-digit organic average daily sales growth to continue in fiscal q4, as evidenced by our june reading. if, however, we were to see a change in environment at any point, we're prepared to adjust quickly.
through the pandemic, we've become more agile, and we've improved our ability to course-correct. in addition, our balance sheet remains strong, and our cash generation will continue improving, leaving us well positioned to capitalize on any opportunities that would emerge. i'll now turn things over to kristen.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. i'll begin on slide 4 of our presentation where you can see key metrics for the fiscal third quarter on a reported basis. slide 5 reflects the adjusted results, which is where i'll focus most of my comments today. our third quarter sales were up 10.7% versus the same quarter last year and came in at $959 million.
our non-safety and non-janitorial product lines grew nearly 13%, and sales of safety and janitorial products improved sequentially to flat. looking at growth rates for our sales by customer type. government sales declined nearly 10% due to the difficult janitorial and safety comps. the comps have begun to ease, and we do expect government sales to return to growth in q4.
national account growth was high teens, and core customers grew low double digits. moving to more technical and solutions-oriented business remains an integral part of our mission critical strategy. sales to customers with solutions now represent roughly 55% of the total company sales. within that solutions umbrella, our in-plant program moved to nearly 10% of total company sales in q3.
you may recall that our goal was to reach 10% by the end of fiscal 2023. so progress is accelerating faster than anticipated. the remaining approximately 45% of company sales to solutions customers are made up primarily of our vending and vendor-managed inventory channels. as erik mentioned, our gross margin for the fiscal third quarter was 42.9%, up 40 basis points sequentially from our second quarter and up 60 basis points from last year's fiscal q3.
reported operating expenses in the third quarter were $271 million versus last year's reported operating expenses of $257 million. adjusted for acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating expenses were $271 million or 28.3% of net sales versus last year's adjusted operating expenses of $257 million or 29.7% of net sales. this represents a 140 basis point reduction in adjusted opex to sales year over year. we incurred approximately $3.3 million of restructuring and other costs in the quarter as compared to $1.3 million in the prior-year quarter.
our reported operating margin was 14.3% compared to 14.8% in the same period last year. as you may recall, included in last year's q3 operating margin was a $20.8 million impairment loss recovery. adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs as well as the prior-year's impairment loss recovery, adjusted operating margin was 14.6% as compared to adjusted operating margin of 12.6%, a 200 basis point improvement year over year. and as erik mentioned earlier, that resulted in an adjusted incremental margin for our third quarter of just over 33%.
that puts us at a year-to-date incremental margin of 24%. so we feel confident we will exceed our original fiscal 2022 incremental margin goal of 20%. reported earnings per share were $1.78 as compared to $1.68 in the same prior-year period. adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs as well as the prior-year's impairment loss recovery, adjusted earnings per share were $1.82 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.42 in the prior-year period, an increase of 28%.
this is a result of our execution at all levels, sales performance, gross margin and opex leverage. turning to the balance sheet. you can see that as of the end of the fiscal third quarter, we were carrying $680 million of inventory, up $22 million from q2's balance of $658 million. the inventory build is consistent with our double-digit revenue growth, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and the continuing inflation.
accounts receivables are also rising with the current sales growth. as expected, we saw a sequential improvement in our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income. q3 cash conversion was 78% compared to slightly negative cash conversion last quarter and 22% conversion for last year's q3. our capital expenditures were $14 million in the third quarter.
moving ahead to slide 7, you can see the uses of working capital also impacted our free cash flow, which came in at $64 million for the current quarter as compared to $3 million in the prior-year quarter. as discussed last quarter, we expect cash conversion to continue improving and we remain on track for the full year fiscal 2022 cash conversion to reach approximately 70% to 80%. our total debt at the end of the fiscal third quarter was $790 million, reflecting a $45 million decrease from our second quarter. as for the composition of our debt, roughly 56% was floating rate debt and the other 44% was fixed rate debt.
cash and cash equivalents were $29 million, resulting in net debt of $761 million at the end of the quarter, down from $794 million at the end of the second quarter. i will now provide an update on our mission critical productivity goals. you may recall that our updated cost savings goal for fiscal 2023 is a minimum of $100 million versus our fiscal 2019 cost base. as you can see on slide 8, our cumulative savings through fiscal 2021 were $60 million, and we had invested roughly $22 million over that same period.
in our fiscal third quarter, we achieved additional savings of $4 million and invested another $2 million. that brings our year-to-date savings and investments to $20 million and $13 million, respectively. we fully expect to achieve $25 million in gross savings and reach $15 million of investments for fiscal 2022, and we remain on target to hit at least $100 million of gross cost savings by fiscal 2023. before i turn it back to erik, let me share a few comments on our fiscal fourth quarter expectations.
keep in mind that this fiscal year includes a 53rd week, so there will be an extra five selling days in the quarter. that extra week of sales is expected to carry a roughly 20% opex to sales ratio. on an ads basis, we expect to continue growing at a double-digit pace for the quarter. sequentially, we anticipate gross margins will likely see the typical seasonal headwinds as the benefit of the latest price increase will more or less be offset by a lower rebate accrual and increased purchase costs.
we also expect to continue leveraging our strong growth, such that incremental margins, while not at the level of our q3, should still be in the mid-20s. all of that should get us comfortably into the top tier of our fiscal 2022 annual operating margin framework, which you can see on slide 9. last point on q4. the numbers i just referenced are on an organic basis, excluding the impact of engman-taylor.
let me provide some color on engman-taylor. with annual sales of roughly $60 million, the business will be about 30 basis points dilutive to our gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter, roughly neutral to eps in fiscal '22 and accretive to eps thereafter. more importantly, it's expected to achieve an roic above our weighted average cost of capital in the first full year of operations. one final area i'd like to discuss, as erik mentioned, and we are all aware, many are concerned about the economy.
first, let me reiterate that we currently do not see signs of a slowdown. but if a slowdown were to occur, we are well positioned to weather the storm. our balance sheet remains strong. and as we've shown numerous times historically, when the economy slows, we generate strong cash flow as working capital becomes a source of funds.
this enables us to strategically invest through the downturn. in addition, through mission critical, we have already built momentum, removing structural costs from our business and plan to continue doing so. finally, our growth initiatives are still ramping and should continue to fuel growth above the ip index under any economic scenario. for all of these reasons, we feel well positioned regardless of the environment.
i'll now turn it back to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. our company remains firmly in growth and execution mode. with each passing quarter, we are gaining traction. we look forward to closing the fiscal year strong with double-digit top-line growth, gross margin expansion and adjusted incremental margins in the mid-20s.
i want to thank our entire team for their dedication and their hard work. and we'll now open up the line for questions.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, ryan. how are you?
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
doing well. let me say, first off, thanks for all the details on the outlook. i know it's a tricky time, so we appreciate it. can i start with price? i think it was contributing 7% in the quarter.
and i know you don't want to give price and volume assumptions for '23, but should we assume that there's more price at sort of the midpoint of the sales guidance versus volume?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, ryan. so first of all, the 700 bps is a little bit lower, closer to 600. the '23 contribution from price, yes, i would say that's fair to assume that at the lower end of the range, that there is a disproportionately higher contribution from price upright.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. ok. and then on the macro assumptions, makes sense what you provided. when you say that contracting industrial economy, can you just put a finer point on that? are you thinking ip down in the like 5% range? or would it -- could it be worse at that lower end? how are you thinking about that?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, ryan. so it's certainly an interesting time because we start by -- if you look at the current results, the current conditions with our customers are still solid. and you could see september's growth rate, good october, kristen mentioned is trending similarly. so we're starting the year off in positive ip territory and obviously, double-digit growth territory.
so the assumptions we're making -- and look, our guess is as good as yours, right? this is really uncertain times. basically, you have the high end of the range, the low end of the range. yes, so we're indexing it on ip, ryan. and effectively, where we're at is the high end of the range assumes a flat ip.
now this is through the course an average of our fiscal year. so realize that we're starting in positive territory, even the higher end of our band here is assuming that conditions erode, and that the ip erode so that -- such that by the back half of our fiscal, the math would work out that at some point, ip turns negative. it just would be modestly negative to get you to an average of flat. the low end of the range on the other hand, assumes more aggressive erosion in the environment such that the average of the full year is negative ip.
so you can imagine if we're starting the year in positive territory to get to a negative average for the year by the back half of our fiscal, we're in pretty healthy negative territory. that's the assumption.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
make sense. ok, and then just last one. heavy manufacturing packer sales. and from what i hear, those customers have big backlogs, higher than normal.
is that something you're hearing? and is that something that is a little bit different this cycle that could help sustain sales, maybe a little bit longer than we're thinking?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
ryan, i do think it's possible. so what we're hearing from customers is, yes, conditions now are stable, and i do think part of that is you take industries, ryan, that have been on their back for so long, like aerospace and even automotive, where there's just -- it's been such a supply constrained industry that there is a larger -- yeah, i think that's a fair point. so there is the potential that, that could carry us for a while. we'll see, but i think it's a fair observation.
ryan merkel -- william blair and company -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks. congrats.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer

the next question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies. please go ahead.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the question. maybe just building off of that, erik, it sounds like what you're saying is that you're sort of looking at the big broad macro picture and trying to be sort of prudent.
but not actually hearing any real issues from any of your customers? i think maybe you mentioned some of the consumer-facing guys. just any more color on what your customers are actually saying?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yes, steve. so in general, i would say right now, our revenues feel solid. when we look at our own internal trends feel solid, customer activity levels are solid with some isolated pockets. so anything touching consumer right now, that's where they're feeling some softening.
so for instance, the food processing sector is feeling in a bit. rv industry, you could imagine, is actually down quite a bit. but for the bulk of our customer base that's heavy industry, it's still solid. what we are hearing in fairness, steve, is we're hearing caution.
so a lot of our customers, as they look ahead, they're not seeing it in their business. but i think some of that just could be self-fulfilling. everyone's reading the headlines. everybody is seeing the sentiment of the disease.
so they're expressing caution for '23, which is why we're taking a somewhat cautious stance in our guidance range. but in terms of what we're seeing now, no, it's still good.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. thanks. and then is it possible -- this may not be a fair question, but what do you think your exposure is to sort of consumer type end markets, just roughly?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
really, it's one of those that's really tough to give you a number, steve, because so many of our customers, job shops, machine shops that are doing work for multiple industries. it's tough for us to get to a number, but what i would tell you is it's pretty small. the bulk of our business is heavy industry and not consumer-facing.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
yeah, that's what i thought. and then a final one, i'll pass it on. i'm just curious how we should think about we're seeing the declines in lots of input costs, whether it's metals or other commodities, i mean, even energy lately, transportation and logistics costs are down, at least on the big indexes? and how do we think about how that sort of plays through to you guys?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, steve. so the first thing i'll say is, you're correct on all of those things coming down. this is a bit of an unusual cycle in that you have other factors that are sort of buying costs. and you're seeing inflation numbers continue to outpace what expectations are every month.
we're still seeing cost increases coming from our suppliers late through -- late calendar '22, and we're hearing it maven be early calendar '23, certainly not at the rate and pace at wards or the size, but still there. you have -- labor is a major issue and a major input cost for most companies and wage rates are still high. so that's being it a little bit. i will tell you in terms of ultimately if things really do come down.
historically, yeah, you can never say never. but historically, our product lines for the most part do not see price deflation. there could be a period where we don't get price, but they don't come down in past cycles. and the reason is typically most of what we sell, the raw material itself is a relatively small percentage of the finished good.
and so you have lots of other factors. now again, never say never, but historically, it's not meant price deflation.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
i appreciate the time.

erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, dave.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
first off, erik, when you talked about the framework, and you said it will -- you'd report above framework in theory if conditions do not deteriorate, just to be 100% clear here. when you say do not deteriorate, you mean ip does not slow from the current mid-single-digit growth rate. you don't just mean it's positive, right?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. basically, what we meant, dave, is that look, if ip the top of our framework assumes roughly a flat ip, plus or minus a bit. so if ip for the year were nicely positive, what we're saying is meaning a couple of points or more, that we would expect to be on top above the framework. and look, proof point is take a look at september positive, nicely positive ip and where the growth rate is tracking is obviously well above the top end of the range is, and we're seeing the same thing for october, roughly plus or minus.
so that's what we meant.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
all right. thank you for that. and then relative to the framework, you mentioned that the et and tower are going to add a couple of points of growth via acquisition. did you mention, kristen, what of the remaining 3% to 7% is price mix at this point? and then a related question there's, within that assumption, and i guess you're talking about a sliding scale because you sort of straddled the calendar year, are you assuming that price goes flat at some point in your framework methodology?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. dave, a few thoughts. first, we didn't break down the growth, and it does kind of vary whether you're at the low end of the framework or the high end, and that's because of the assumptions around price and what you get price carryover i think it's definitely fair to assume we'd be targeting that 400 basis points of share gain regardless of where ip falls. and then there would be potentially some upside to perhaps share gain volume assumptions.
the -- i think the second part of your question was on whether or not price cost went flat in the year. did i catch that right?
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, it does not. so we're still price positive for the year. we're expecting not to flip to a headwind in that regard until fiscal '24 based on everything that we're seeing right now and the timing of the costs roll off from the balance sheet.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
got it. ok. and then just one small one here. in your segment breakdown or your customer breakdown, you reallocated some previously other non-manufacturing customers.
i think it looks like a lot of them landed in heavy manufacturing. i'm confused by that. could you just talk about what the definition change to other was?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, so not so much a definition change to other. but happened there, dave, is we have a process where we use a third party to help us account for which of those segments our customers fall into. and a lot of times, it's kind of difficult to attribute them to one or the other because, as erik mentioned before, you have oftentimes like job shop coming in, you don't necessarily know where to apply them. so we actually have a manual process that happens.
like after the third party kind of does its first pass, we go in and we say, ok, where do we actually think the best end market or segment is to attribute this customer to. and we've basically gotten backlog this year with the number of new customers that have come in, and we did a big kind of process improvement on that in the fourth quarter, and that's why you saw that shift out of other and into the other bucket. so we feel pretty good about the change that we made and the ability to do that on a much more regular basis going forward.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok, got it. all right. thank you. see you in a couple weeks.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
take care.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, dave.

and our last question today comes from ken newman with keybanc. please go ahead.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
hey, ken.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i just had a clarifying question on price. from a price perspective here, maybe just any color on how much of sales growth guide for this year, the carryover effect from the price increases you enacted last year?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
ken, i think you're...
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
can you repeat that? 
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
you're a little bit hard to hear. it's kind of breaking up a little bit.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i was just asking, within the sales growth side, any color on how much that is the carryover effect from increases that you enacted last year?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we didn't give a specific range on that comp. but the way i'd tell you to think about it is if you go back and look at the timing of the price increases in '22, you're still getting a healthy benefit from price, like if you kind of think sequentially through the year, i'd expect price to be peaking in the first quarter based on the timing and the amount of those increases that went into effect in '22. and then because of the price carryover, which is pretty healthy at the low end of the framework you should assume a disproportionately higher contribution from price and at the high end of that.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then you're -- for my follow-up, you're expecting a pretty strong free cash flow this year, and you've already done a few deals in the last few quarters. maybe talk a little bit more about the m&a funnel expectations for more deals this year?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. ken, and happy to do that. and maybe what i'll do is even zoom out a bit from m&a and just to our capital allocation philosophy in a fairly unique time. look, so we're sitting -- we feel very good about our position right now.
we're sitting at plus or minus a turn and half of leverage, which is a comfortable spot for us. what i would say is, this year, more than others, given what's happened with interest rates, we're going to be really scrutinous about how we use cash. look, priority one remains reinvestment into the core business, which we're pleased. we've got some areas we've highlighted that we think are really working.
we're pleased there. priority 2 is going to be continued steady growth of the ordinary dividend. and then we've got three things on our mind in terms of what we do with excess free cash flow that we expect to generate. and those three are debt reduction, share buyback and m&a.
and we're going to look at all three and evaluate returns carefully. what i would tell you with respect to m&a, ken, is what you're seeing us do as part of our strategy here, we've built out a couple of platforms that really fit into our brand of being on the plant floor, technical and high touch. obviously, metal work can be the roots of the business, the c-part consumables or ccsg business being a second platform and oem fasteners being a third. what you saw us do in the last quarter was tuck-in deals.
so relatively small compared to company size into those platforms. and i think if you see us do m&a this year, it will be a continuation of that theme, which will be relatively small and tuck-ins to existing platforms. so given the current environment, i would not expect us, i mean, you never say never again, but the hurdle would have to be really high to do something big and really high to do something that's outside of one of those core platforms.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
right. maybe just one more follow-on to that. i mean, maybe a little bit more color on how you think about -- how do you expect operating margins that you once discussed here, do you expect that the margin profiles for tower and engman-taylor is kind of get [inaudible] or any color in terms of where you expect that?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, ken, you were breaking up a little, but i think we'll spit back your question here, tell us if we get it right is where you're going is the margin profile on the small -- on the tuck-in acquisitions and how it performs over time. if i've got that right, typically, it's very typical what we see with a smaller distributor that their gross and operating margins are going to be well below mscs to start. and that's very typical of the industry. and so what happens is out of the gate year 1, as kristen highlighted in our margin framework, you see an immediate dilution effect to margin percentages.
what happens over time though is we have a great opportunity to lift those margins, both gross margins and operating margins with all the synergy cases. and those are purchasing synergies, those are cross-selling synergies, those are all kinds of cost synergies like freight opportunities and things to take advantage of msc scale. and so what we see is the incremental margins, once we own the business, the incremental margins are actually quite good. and we can get those businesses really to grow, maybe not quite to msc level company average margins, but well above where they are today.
and so the deal economics actually become really good, especially when we're looking at return on capital, as we highlighted, we should be above wacc within first full year. they're pretty compelling.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
appreciate it. thanks.

[operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to john chironna, vice president of investor relations and treasurer. please go ahead.
john chironna -- vice president of investor relations and treasurer
thank you, andrew, and good morning to everyone. erik gershwind, our chief executive officer; and kristen actis-grande, our chief financial officer, are both on the call with me today. during today's call, we will refer to various financial and management data in the presentation slides that accompany our comments as well as our operational statistics, both of which can be found on our investor relations web page. let me reference our safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, a summary of which is on slide 2 of the accompanying presentation.
our comments on this call as well as the supplemental information we are providing on the website contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the u.s. securities laws, including statements about the high inflationary environment and global economic conditions on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition expected future results, expected benefits from the investment in strategic plans and other initiatives and expected future growth and profitability. these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. information about these risks is noted in our earnings press release and the risk factors in the md&a sections of our latest annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec as well as in our other sec filings.
these risk factors include our comments on the high inflationary environment and global economic conditions. these forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements, except as required by applicable law. investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. in addition, during this call, we may refer to certain adjusted financial results, which are non-gaap measures.
please refer to the gaap versus non-gaap reconciliations in our presentation or on our website, which contain the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures. i'll now turn the call over to erik. 
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. i hope you're all doing well. we had an exciting year, and our fiscal fourth quarter was definitely no different.
on today's call, i'll reflect on our recent performance, share my perspective on the current environment and outline our goals for fiscal '23. i'll also discuss our fourth quarter acquisition of tower fasteners. kristen will provide more specifics on q4 and on our fiscal '23 framework. i'll then wrap things up, and we'll open the line up for questions.
before i get into our performance, i'd like to mention our newest member of the msc executive team, chief operating officer, martina mcisaac. martina started at the beginning of this month and come to us from hilti corporation with a proven track record of driving both top-line growth and profitability improvements. her experience in implementing an organic revenue growth engine and expanding share of wallet in adjacent products and services fits perfectly with our strategy. equally exciting, it's her experience with using lean and six sigma to improve productivity, operating rigor and execution.
we're thrilled to have martina on board. over the past year, we've made our culture and talent development, a core focus of our business. the addition of martina further emphasizes our growth on this front. martina has lived by values and principles that line up perfectly with msc.
she's a strong leader of people and a strong advocate of de&i. we're also in the midst of refocusing our esg program and more clearly communicating our progress, building on a legacy of good corporate citizenship since the founding of our company. we'll be releasing our annual esg report next month, and i look forward to further discussing our esg goals moving forward. now, on to our recent results.
our fiscal fourth quarter continued our string of strong financial performance and execution. we achieved average daily revenue growth of 14%, which is well above the ip index. we expanded adjusted operating margins by 190 basis points over prior year, driven by a 200-basis-point reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of sales. zooming out from the quarter and looking at the full fiscal year of '22, i'm equally pleased.
we achieved average daily revenue growth of nearly 11%, roughly 600 basis points above the ip index and above our goal of a 400-basis-point spread. this was aided by strong price contribution, bolt-on acquisitions and successful execution of our growth drivers, which i'll speak to shortly. we expanded adjusted operating margins by 140 basis points over prior year. in fact, adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales are at their lowest mark since fiscal 2012.
this was aided by our mission-critical initiative, which has already yielded $85 million of structural cost reductions and productivity and is on track to exceed our original goal of $100 million by the end of fiscal '23. finally, adjusted roic is already into the high teens at nearly 18%, a year ahead of schedule with our fiscal '23 targets. our growth formula remains anchored in the five priorities that we've been discussing as part of the mission-critical initiative. and those are metalworking, solutions, selling the portfolio, digital and customer diversification with an emphasis on public sector.
i'll now update you on each of those growth drivers. metalworking remains the cornerstone of our value proposition. we use a combination of our broad and deep product offering, an extensive network of technical metalworking expertise and digital innovation to drive productivity and cost savings for our customers, and this leads to high customer retention rates and to new growth opportunities. in many cases, we also help our customers to reduce waste, helping them achieve their sustainability goals.
a recent example illustrates this. we just won a proposal to supply cutting tools and broad line mro to a component producer for the energy industry. in doing so, we identified over $200,000 in annual savings at just one of their many locations. the savings come in the form of increased metal removal rates, reduced weights, carbon recycling and reuse opportunities, and we also found safety improvements.
as a result, the customer has now asked us to implement the same process at a different location where we've since identified another $300,000 in savings. our second growth driver is solutions. this includes our vending and implant programs, both of which continue gaining traction and adding to share gains. vending signings were up 21% in our fiscal fourth quarter year over year, and vending sales now represent 15% of total company sales.
likewise, implant signings increased 42% and now represent 11% of total company sales. you may recall that our original goal was to reach 10% by the end of fiscal '23. so we've surpassed that goal a year early, and we'll continue to push on that program. sales to customers with our solutions offerings now represent 56% of total company sales, up nearly 200 basis points from prior year.
the third priority is selling the portfolio, which is about increasing share of wallet through ancillary products, especially our ccsg business. here, we provide an outsourced vendor-managed inventory service for the c-part consumables that keep plants running. for our customers, we're taking over a difficult-to-manage category that can shut down a plant. for msc, these are high-margin items that because of the vmi solution, result in high retention rates.
we've been focused on this business, and we're seeing nice momentum with q4 ads growth rates in the mid-teens. our fourth priority is digital, also referred to as e-commerce. as you may recall, we hired a new chief digital and information officer, john hill, a few quarters back. he and team have been quite busy improving our website and reviewing our entire digital offering.
so far, the feedback we've received from the field is excellent. our e-commerce sales grew by 20% in our fiscal fourth quarter on an ads basis and reached 63% of total company sales, up roughly 300 basis points compared to prior year. our fifth growth driver is customer diversification through our public sector business. over the past few quarters, i've described the building momentum, including several contract wins such as the 4pl contract serving u.s.
marine bases. that contract is ramping up and as a result, our q4 ads government growth rate was over 30%. we expect strong growth to continue into fiscal '23. outside of our organic growth drivers, we also added two tuck-in acquisitions in our fiscal fourth quarter, and both are tracking to performance targets.
it will each be nicely accretive to earnings in fiscal '23, and we expect roic to exceed our weighted average cost of capital within the first full year of operations for each. most recently, we acquired tower fasteners, a long island new york-based distributor of oem fasteners and components. tower will be joined with ais, the oem fastener business we acquired in 2018. you'll recall that we identified oem fasteners as a natural extension of our mission-critical value proposition on plant floors across north america.
oem fasteners, like metalworking and like class c consumables, are both technical and high touch. we've spent the past few years shoring up the ais foundation by bolstering its management team, systems and cross-selling capabilities with msc. with those strengths now in place, we're turning our attention to growth, and tower is a great start. mark shannon and his team are a terrific addition to this platform, and we expect to see continued growth.
turning to the external environment. the headlines are filled with the growing likelihood of recession. this is also reflected in eroding readings on the sentiment indices and declining ip forecasts. while we do see some pockets of softening in consumer-facing industries, the majority of our customers are still seeing stable order levels, demand and general activity.
we do, however, hear more caution expressed by our customers when it comes to calendar 2023 conditions. we're going to keep a careful eye on the environment and keep our ear to the ground with respect to both customers and suppliers. at the same time, the need for our customers to find productivity to offset their own cost headwinds is as high as it's ever been. and this plays really nicely into our value proposition.
so we remain focused on delivering that productivity for our customers. with that as a backdrop, i'll now look ahead and outline our fiscal '23 goals. and they're largely a continuation of our current mission-critical objectives as we look to build on our recent momentum. first, we remain focused on capturing market share.
specifically, we aim to continue outperforming our original growth target of 400 basis points above the ip index, just as we did in fiscal '22. as of now, we foresee average daily sales growth of between 5% and 9% for the fiscal year. this range assumes a contracting industrial economy at the low end and a flat economy at the higher end of the range as an average across our fiscal '23. now given that we've started the year -- the fiscal year in positive territory, the bottom end of the range implies significant erosion through the year.
the top end of the range implies more modest erosion in the environment during the rest of our fiscal year. if conditions do not deteriorate, we would expect to come in above the guided range. inside the company, i can tell you that we're rallying to even higher rates of market share capture, particularly if the market softens. as the bulk of our competitors are local and regional distributors, who will struggle disproportionately.
our second goal is to continue expanding adjusted operating margins. we do this by leveraging revenue growth and by executing our mission-critical initiatives, which will yield at least an additional $15 million in cost savings, achieving our goal of at least $100 million by the end of fiscal '23. kristen will go into more detail on our guidance range shortly. and third, we aim to further improve adjusted roic, lifting it beyond the current 18% and closer to 20%.
we've set these goals amid an uncertain environment. should being softened even further than what we've currently envisioned, we have identified multiple levers to pull, and we're prepared to adjust quickly through our downturn playbook. kristen will also say a few more words on that shortly. in addition, our balance sheet remains strong, and our cash generation will continue improving, leaving us well positioned to capitalize on any opportunities that emerge.
kristen will now take you through the financials, including our new annual guidance range.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you, erik. i'll begin with a review of our fiscal fourth quarter, then update you on the progress of our mission-critical initiatives. before i turn it back over to erik, i'll close with our thoughts and guidance on fiscal 2023. on slides 4 and 5 of our presentation, you can see key metrics for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year on a reported basis.
slides 6 and 7 reflect the adjusted results, which will be my primary focus this morning. our fourth quarter sales were up 23% versus the same quarter last year and came in at $1.02 billion. this includes the 53rd week this fiscal year. so on an ads basis, our sales were up 14% for the quarter as compared to the same quarter last year.
our fourth quarter acquisitions represented nearly 250 basis points of the growth. looking at growth rates for our average daily sales by customer type, government sales increased over 30%, fueled by fulfillment under our 4pl contract for the u.s. marine bases and other public sector spending. national account growth was high teens, and core customers grew high single digits.
our gross margin for the fiscal fourth quarter was 41.9%, down 100 basis points sequentially from our third quarter and down 10 basis points from last year's fiscal q4. the quarterly decline includes approximately 60 basis points from the seasonal product mix of summer goods, headwinds from the acceleration in the public sector growth rate and a 40-basis-point impact from our recent acquisitions. we continue to see inflation from our suppliers, particularly on the metalworking side of the business, albeit at a slower pace than the past year. in response to supplier moves, we implemented a roughly 1% price increase in august.
realization rates remain strong as our customers are hungry for product availability and for tangible productivity gains. msc continues to deliver on both fronts, as evidenced by the example that erik shared earlier. reported operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $290 million versus last year's reported operating expenses of $253 million. adjusted for acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating expenses were also $290 million or 28.3% of net sales versus last year's adjusted operating expenses of $252 million or 30.3% of net sales.
this 200-basis-point reduction in adjusted opex to sales year over year is a testament to the continued success of our mission-critical initiatives. we incurred approximately $4.1 million of restructuring and other costs in the quarter as compared to $4.4 million in the prior-year quarter. we also recognized a $10.1 million gain on the sale of our melville, new york facility, and we have adjusted that out as well to improve comparability. our reported operating margin was 14.1% compared to 11% in the same period last year.
adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs as well as the current year gain on sale of property, adjusted operating margin was 13.6% as compared to adjusted operating margin of 11.7%, a nearly 200-basis-point improvement year over year. that resulted in an adjusted incremental margin for our fourth quarter of approximately 22%. for the full year fiscal 2022, we achieved a reported operating margin of 12.7% and on an adjusted basis, 12.9%, which was squarely in the top tier of our annual operating margin framework. i'll note here that the extra week added roughly 60 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points to our full year adjusted operating margins.
our full year adjusted incremental margin was just over 23%, exceeding our original fiscal 2022 adjusted incremental margin goal of 20%. reported earnings per share were $1.86 for the quarter as compared to $1.18 in the same prior-year period. adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs as well as the current year's gain on sale of property, adjusted earnings per share were $1.79 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 in the prior-year period, an increase of 42%. this continues to reflect strong execution at all levels, sales performance, gross margin levels and opex leverage.
turning to the balance sheet. you can see that as of the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, we were carrying $716 million of inventory, up $36 million from q3's balance. the inventory build is consistent with our double-digit revenue growth, the ongoing supply chain disruptions and continuing inflation. accounts receivable are also rising with the current sales growth.
as expected, we saw continued sequential improvement in our cash flow conversion or operating cash flow divided by net income. q4 cash conversion was 106% compared to 78% cash conversion last quarter. this brings our annual cash conversion rate to 72% in the range of the 70% to 80% we communicated earlier this year. our capital expenditures were $16 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year capex to roughly $60 million.
moving ahead to slide 10. you can see our free cash flow is also up year over year at $95 million for the current quarter as compared to $69 million in the prior-year quarter. note that we also spent about $22 million buying back shares during the quarter, just over 300,000 shares at an average price of $73.75. finally, we also announced a 5% increase in our ordinary dividend to be paid in november.
our total debt at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter was $795 million, reflecting a $5 million increase from our third quarter. as for the composition of our debt, roughly 57% was floating rate debt and the other 43% was fixed rate debt. cash and cash equivalents were $44 million, resulting in net debt of $751 million at the end of the quarter, down from $761 million at the end of the third quarter. let me now update you on our mission-critical productivity goals on slide 11.
in our fiscal fourth quarter, we achieved additional savings of $5 million and invested another $2 million. that brings our fiscal year 2022 savings and investments to $25 million and $15 million, respectively, and right in line with our guidance for the year. one of the programs we're quite pleased with is the continued automation enhancements of our distribution centers that strengthens our operations and mitigates the effects of labor inflation. for the total program to date, we have achieved gross savings of $85 million, and we remain on target to hit at least $100 million of gross cost savings by fiscal 2023.
now, let's turn to the fiscal year 2023 guidance, which is shown on slide 12. we are estimating average daily sales growth of 5% to 9% and an adjusted operating margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. let me point out a few factors and assumptions to keep in mind. specific to the ads growth range, fiscal 2023 has 252 days, six fewer days than fiscal 2022.
the full fiscal calendar can be found on our website. as we mentioned before, we made two acquisitions during our fourth quarter. these are included in the guidance and add roughly 200 basis points to our ads growth for the year. in terms of our economic assumptions, most readings and forecasts point to a softening environment.
while our growth is currently strong, as evidenced by our september growth rate of 13.5% and october's similar trend, we do assume the industrial economy slowed sequentially through fiscal 2023, and our growth rates will flow accordingly. at the gross margin level, we expect to benefit from a favorable price cost spread to offset most of the typical 30 to 50-basis-point headwind we experienced from customer and channel mix. on a year-over-year basis, acquisitions will pose a 30 to 40-basis-point headwind. overall, we expect full year gross margins to be down 40 to 70 basis points versus fiscal 2022.
on the operating expense line, we expect continued reduction on a percentage of sales basis despite ongoing headwinds from freight and labor inflation, and we will continue to strategically invest in the business in support of our mission-critical growth strategy. as i mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve additional cost savings through our mission-critical program of at least $15 million. factoring in those assumptions, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.3%. excluding the 20-basis-point benefit of the extra week from fiscal 2022, this would reflect operating expansion -- operating margin expansion at nearly all points within our range.
also note that the recently completed acquisitions dilute operating margins by approximately 20 basis points in fiscal '23, their first full year with us. while dilutive to operating margins in the first year, both acquisitions are accretive to eps and on track to achieve an roic above wacc in their first full year of operations. lastly, on an operating margin on operating margin, and as i mentioned earlier, please keep in mind that the 53rd week added about 20 basis points to our full year fiscal 2022 operating margin. for modeling purposes, i'd like to give some additional color on the quarterly progression through the year.
we expect gross margins to remain at a consistent level, plus or minus 20 basis points. additionally, as we continue to benefit from our mission-critical initiatives, we expect our adjusted operating expense as a percent of sales and adjusted operating margin to improve sequentially as we progress through the year. a couple of additional and important points. please note that given the current interest rate environment and expectations for further rate hikes, interest expense will rise significantly.
holding fiscal '23 debt constant with current levels, we would expect roughly $8 million to $10 million of interest expense per quarter and tax rates of slightly under 25%. given our expectations for an operating cash flow conversion over 100%, we will have flexibility to deploy free cash into debt reduction, buybacks or accretive acquisitions. one final area i'd like to discuss is our downturn playbook. while we are not yet experiencing any signs of a slowdown, we are well positioned to navigate a change in the environment.
we have clearly defined the triggers for changes in our actual or forecasted revenue and operating profit that initiate a series of actions we will take across the business. this includes everything from pullback on discretionary spending, changes in staffing levels and reprioritization of investments. in addition, our balance sheet remains strong. and when the economy slows, we generate high levels of cash flow as working capital becomes a source of funds.
this will enable us to pay down debt and/or to strategically invest through the downturn. so while we certainly prefer the current environment, we feel well positioned regardless of whatever happens. i will now turn it back over to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, kristen. as we wrap up fiscal '22 and we're full speed ahead into fiscal '23, i remain quite pleased with our company's performance. we are tracking to each of our mission-critical goals for the end of fiscal '23 and are seeing momentum build within -- inside the company. regardless of the macro environment, we'll remain squarely focused on what we can control, capturing market share and hence, growing well above ip, and then translating that growth into profit expansion.
i'd like to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication, and we'll now open up the line for questions.

good morning, tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
i wanted to start by circling back on some of the macro commentary that you both offered. erik, i took note of your comment about a pronounced slowdown in the second half of december. and, kristen, i think the key words from your prepared remarks were the tempering a bit and just in terms of the macro and growth outlook. so, i was -- i was hoping you could give us any more insight you have there, in particular, if there's any difference across some of the end markets, that would be helpful.
thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, tommy, sure. look, i think the headline in terms of the macro is pretty much more of the same. on the last quarter, we talked about some pockets of softening in line with some of the readings coming down. and i think that's what we're still experiencing, so we would characterize the environment as very solid.
look, i mean, we're still talking about nice growth levels. most of our customers are still talking about solid demand and solid order patterns. there are pockets though. and, you know, it tends to be the closer you get to consumer-facing industries, the more extensive you're going to hear the pockets of softening.
so, in general, i think we're not seeing anything that suggests like anything falling off a cliff. the words, i think, kristen referred to are tempering, which would be an appropriate characterization. with respect to december, in particular, from what we could tell, the back half of december is an isolated phenomenon. we saw a really strong start.
so, to put some context on that, the first couple of weeks, the growth rates would have been better than q1. the back half definitely slowed. and we did hear from our sales team that customer -- holiday-related shutdowns were more widespread than the last couple of years and then throw in weather that disrupted things that week before christmas. so, it appears to be what we saw back half of december isolated and nothing systemic.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
thank you, erik. that's helpful. as a follow-up, i wanted to touch on the pricing environment. it sounds like you've continued to see some supplier price increases.
there's -- i think you said you've got another one of your own planned for next month. so, any context you could give there? and then just thinking through how that ties to your 2023 outlook for ads -- on my math, you saw about a 700-basis-point contribution this quarter. presumably the range of expected contributions for the year would be significantly lower than that just given the comps. but if there's any way you could frame what's reasonable for the full year, that would be helpful as well.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, tommy, sure. i'll start out. i'll touch on the environment. i can give you a little context on our numbers, and kristen can fill in anything i missed.
so, in terms of the environment, it's an interesting time because on the one hand, like the whole world is suffering from inflation fatigue. and our customers, our suppliers were all not immune from that. at the same time, the reality of the situation is that there's still inflation. and while it is definitely moderating, there's still inflation and there's still cost increases as evidenced by the fact that, yes, we're still seeing suppliers coming to us with increases.
and so, that is what drove what i described is going to be a pricing adjustment coming up in the next month. so, it's a reality that we all have to deal with, even though there's a bit of fatigue. and i think the message for us is we're really focused for our customers on making sure we're generating productivity for them. that's going to offset it.
i think that's how i characterize the macro. yeah, in terms of our numbers, and i'm pretty sure this is all sort of baked into what we gave as the guidance range at the start of the year, we did anticipate that we would lap the very high pricing of prior year. and that's going to happen during our fiscal second quarter in the next month or so here. so, yeah.
as a percentage of sales, pricing contribution will absent some radical change in the environment. pricing contribution will come down because of the math of the comps.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
all right. appreciate it and will turn it back.

our next question today will come from steve volkmann of jefferies. please go ahead.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. good morning, everybody. thanks. erik, i noted in your prepared comments that you actually said you were starting to see some of the benefits of reshoring poking their head up.
can you just expand on that a little bit?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure, stephen. good morning. i would say very, very early.
so, we're not so much yet seeing it in our revenue -- you're not seeing it in our revenues. what we are starting to see from our sales team is lists of new construction and projects that are going up, buildings being put up. and so, as you can imagine, our business development team, we're all over that. it's fairly widespread in terms of geography and in terms of industry type.
i would say heavy emphasis on manufacturing, obviously. but the tangible evidence now is it's going from talk into new construction. so, it's a bit early to see it in our numbers. but if we do our jobs right and we get involved with those customers from the ground up, that should translate into the numbers in the coming quarters.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks. and then maybe a kristen question.
i think you mentioned 20 basis points is the expectation for operating margin dilution from the acquisitions in '23. historically -- i guess i'm still kind of new to you guys. historically, as you go out into '24, '25, would you expect that to narrow or even reverse and, ultimately, you get margin accretion?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. we would definitely expect it to narrow, and it eventually does become on par with the core business. so, '24, i don't think you're going to hear much about the noise from those two acquisitions. and then as we run our integration playbook, there are a variety of levers we're pulling that get those businesses on par with the core msc overall business.
steve volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks. i'll pass it on.
operator
our next question today will come from david manthey of baird. please go ahead.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah, thank you. happy new year, everyone.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
happy new year, dave.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
happy new year.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yeah. as it relates to deprioritizing special dividends, if i look back over the past, say, 10 years, it looks like it's well over half a billion dollars. and how should we think about the reallocation of capital? is that higher capex? is it investments in the p&l? and -- or is it just more share repurchase to keep in that one to two leverage range? any details on what you're thinking would be appreciated.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, dave, sure. i'll take this one. so, i would say this. over time, we have had a capital allocation framework that began with two top priorities that are sort of 1a and 1b.
and those are reinvestment into the core business to the extent we see high-return projects. and right now, we're pretty bullish there. and then two is continued steady growth in the ordinary dividend. and no change there.
i think the change in emphasis you heard from kristen is on the next two priorities. the next two priorities are going to be share buyback at the right valuation levels and tuck-in acquisitions. along the lines of what you saw from us in the last quarter, so tuck-ins to existing businesses like the metalworking and oem fastener. and i think the reason there, if you want to -- why the change, it's just the return prospects.
we've always sort of never been wed to one tactic. it's more about where we see deploying the next dollar to its best use. and i think that we feel good about the prospects for the company. and when valuation levels are low in the stock, that's a good use of capital.
and i think you're also hearing from us our confidence growing in the tuck-in acquisitions based on our track record in the past few years. we feel good about the businesses we bought and the results that they're producing. and so, that makes us more bullish on that as well.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
sounds good. thank you. could you talk about how the benefits of the line review will manifest in your results? what should we be looking for?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah, dave. so, a little early to say, but in general -- and maybe what i'll do, and kristen, you can fill in any missing pieces, just sort of step back and talk a little more about the strategy, the philosophy here, and then that will translate into how yields benefit. but as i mentioned in the prepared remarks, dave, if i think about the focus of our category organization for the past really three years now since covid, it's been two things: number one, getting product to make sure we have product on the shelves to keep plants running; and number two, staying ahead of the crazy cost inflation that we've all been experiencing. from our perspective, it was check, check, really good job by our team on both of those.
the world is beginning to migrate to a new normal now, moderating inflation, stabilizing supply chains. this becomes the next natural evolution in the story. so, what we're going to be looking to do is we're going to be looking at our assortment. and you're going to not see us deviate from our idea of having a really broad and really deep product assortment that's very important to our customers.
but what we are going to do is look for opportunities for efficiencies. i think you can expect to see the benefits accrue in the form of purchase cost improvements. and that could either be the straight price we pay for products. it could be in the form of rebates or other adjustments, but that's certainly one area.
i would expect to see benefits accrue in the form of operational efficiencies. to the extent we see potential to collapse at the fringe, at the margin, collapse some product lines or suppliers, etc., that they'd be operational, whether that's inventory savings or some opex and productivity improvements through our supply chain, that would be another area where i would expect to see benefit.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
dave, the only thing i'd add to that is we contemplated that process when we set the framework for the guidance ranges. i alluded to some initiatives coming online in the second half. they're going to change the sequencing of gross margins throughout the year. that would be one of those, but attacking a lot of different things across price, cost, and mix as we think about the second half in particular.
but all kind of within that original operating margin framework of 12.7% to 13.3%.
dave manthey -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
that's great. thank you.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question today will come from paul [inaudible] with william blair. please go ahead.
unknown speaker
hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hi, paul.
unknown speaker
so, first question from me, erik, reflecting on the supply chain environment and the disruptions we've seen over the last couple of years, is there a way you can qualify for us how do you think that the tight supply chain that we saw aided in your share gains over the last couple of years? is there a way to parse out how big of an impact your internal initiatives had in taking share?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
you know, paul, what i would say, look -- qualitatively, what i would say is the past three years created a fairly unique opportunity for large, well-capitalized distributors that were able to -- i was talking earlier about getting product on the shelf. in a tight supply chain environment, a couple of things happened. number one, obviously, scarcity of product. so, having product becomes paramount.
and then the second thing is, obviously, tight supply chain means inflation. and i think the successful distributors, those that fared well through this crazy period, were able to stay ahead of that and maintain or improve margins through what was a historic time. and i feel good about our performance on both of those fronts. i think as we move forward and things normalize, if the question is, ok, does that opportunity, the share capture opportunity go away? our view on it is that like our north star has become generating productivity for our customers because, particularly, what -- in almost any environment you can think of, if they're booming, if things get slow, productivity -- and productivity could mean cost down or it could mean increasing manufacturing throughput to allow them to get more products into their customers' hands faster, that is becoming paramount.
and that's where -- again, if you listen to each of our five growth levers, i tried to get this point across, they're not just about increasing dollar volume. they're intended to all serve a purpose, and it's all around positioning msc as a partner to our customers to generate productivity. that's our north star for the next several years.
unknown speaker
got it. that's very helpful. i appreciate that. the other question from me, and i appreciate the color you guys gave on the macro environment, but are you seeing here in early january, any bifurcation in the order rates between some of your larger customers and the small customers? and maybe if not even on order rates and how they're talking about the year ahead, how would you characterize your conversations with each?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
paul, i'll take that one. so, nothing different than what we've been experiencing for the last few quarters. we're not seeing any deviations there. and we do -- that is kind of one of the things we tend to watch for any early leading indicators.
so, nothing notable to report there. as erik mentioned kind of the macro sentiment, pretty consistent. we're looking more for pockets of softening per end markets at this point. but generally, still feeling good about the year, solid about our expectations and within that 5% to 9% ads guidance range.
unknown speaker
got it. appreciate the help. thank you.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
you're welcome.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, paul.
operator
and our next question today will come from patrick baumann of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
hey, patrick.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
i'm doing well. a quick one to start on inventories. just wanted to get a sense of how you're feeling about current levels of inventory. and you talked about supply chain pressures and inflation easing just -- and then as well as some advantageous buying you've done maybe at year-end, but you've probably been doing that all along.
just curious how you think about inventories moving forward. do you expect some destock now that the situation has kind of normalized around supply chain and inflation? any color on that?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure, pat. i can take that one. so, as you've mentioned at the end of your question, yes, the year-end advantageous buys, that's pretty typical for us.
we're just -- it's part of the normal playbook that we would run. i think more holistically, if you look at inventory, obviously, the last few years when we've been in this constrained supply chain environment, we've been flexing the balance sheet and certainly not skimping on inventory as that's been a way that we've been able to support our customers somewhat uniquely relative to the local distributors in that time period. but going forward, we're definitely taking a closer look at inventory. we're kind of monitoring levels, looking at where it makes sense to adjust things given the environment, but certainly not doing anything that would compromise our ability to support the customer and to support our continued growth.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
based on your standing outlook for ads growth, i mean, what do you -- do you think current levels of inventory are appropriate? do you think you're overstocked a little bit? under stocked? like how would you --
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
i wouldn't say we're overstocked anywhere, and there's definitely been some differences in how we've been seeing kind of inventory levels in certain different product categories, like if we think about kind of metalworking inventory versus mro. but i wouldn't give you a specific range at this point, but i'd definitely say, if you think about the 100% operating cash flow conversion, there's sort of a range of inventory contemplated within that, that we feel confident in.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
i'll follow-up after the call on that. maybe --
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
pat, only other color i'd add on inventory is there's times -- you've followed us for a little while here, like when we go into a different mode. right now, we're still in growth mode. and in growth mode, even if things are moderating, whatever the growth percentages, we're still in growth mode, and that means, you know, keeping inventory on the shelves for customers. if there comes a point -- at some point, there'll be a point at which things change and we go into a different mode, and we -- that's a lever we can turn pretty quickly as part of a downturn playback.
we're not there though.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
understood. then on -- next question is on opex. can you just help me understand the year-over-year moving parts? i mean you went from 257 million of opex in last year's first quarter to 280 million this year. i think acquisitions maybe add a little bit, but you have some gross savings of 6 million, like i think you talked about 1 million of investments.
it just seems like a pretty big increase. i'm guessing a lot of that's inflation related, but any color on the key moving parts in that year-over-year dollar number would be helpful.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. sure, pat. so, a few things on the big drivers on a year-over-year basis. you're right.
inflation is absolutely one of the biggest buckets there. that was around $9 million. we did also have an increase from having those two acquisitions, engman-taylor and towers in the numbers for the first full quarter. that was around 6 million.
year over year, we're still seeing kind of t&e normalize for our associates as we get kind of back to normal and how we've been out in the field. that was a couple of million of pressure, a little bit of noise on the variable opex. and then you've got some ups and things in there on higher d&as, some of the investments carrying over from the prior year. and then to your point, you got 5 million in net mission-critical savings.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
and that 280 million, like as you think about it moving forward is for the rest of the year, is that kind of a -- how should i think about that absolute dollar number in the second quarter and the balance of the year? i guess i'm thinking in context of pricing contributions that are probably moderating, would you expect kind of -- i would expect year over year to moderate on the opex growth as well. is that the right assumption?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, second quarter on a dollar basis, probably down a little bit, but on a rate basis, it will still be up a tad from q1. and then going forward in q3 and q4, kind of given some of the dynamics you described, i think 280 -- low 280 is probably a pretty reasonable probably range for -- probably a good range for q3. and i'd say ticking down even a bit there from q4.
the opex rate following q2 will sequentially decline.
patrick baumann -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
ok. appreciate the color. thanks.
operator
our last question will come from ken newman of keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
good morning.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
good morning, ken.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. maybe i'll just kind of dig into the metalworking demand. obviously, you've talked a little bit about activity being relatively stable within your industrial side of your business. but obviously, the gbi has kind of been -- the metalworking index has kind of been a contraction now for seven months.
and i'm curious, have you seen any weakness within that portion of your business? and how do you view that part of the portfolio going forward?
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. ken, no question. look, you look at the mbi, you look at the pmi, the sentiment indices are dropping considerably. i would say, inside of the company, i would characterize metalworking as a microcosm of what i characterize for the overall customer base, which is moderating and certainly some pockets of softening, but not dropping like a rock and not dropping as the indices would suggest.
i think part of the story, ken, is a lot of -- if you take some of the end markets that drive metalworking consumption, many of them, several of them have been really beat up during covid. and so, they still have room to grow. so, i mentioned aerospace being one. another that drives metalworking consumption through the economy, oil and gas, with oil prices being high, activity levels are up, so that's sort of buoying things.
so, i mean, nothing really to speak of out of the ordinary or out of what we've described for the total company as it relates to metalworking.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. are you concerned at all about a potential lag impact of that sentiment index? or has there been enough structural changes you think that you can help to offset that? because obviously, you've outperformed in the last six months relative to that sentiment index.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, ken, i mean, i wouldn't say concerned. we're watching it. and if you go back and you run historic patterns, typically, there's a pretty good correlation with -- the sentiment is like the mbi and our revenues.
but look, really, that's why you saw -- when we gave the annual guidance of 5% to 9%, that's down considerably from where we're running in q1. and part of that was -- there's a little bit of comps in there from the pricing that we talked about. and then part of that is contemplating some further softening. so, we think it is going to happen.
so, do we watch it? absolutely. are we modeling and planning? yes. do we worry about it? no. because, you know, from our standpoint, we can make strides almost no matter what happens in terms of capturing share from local distributors.
so, that's our assessment.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then my last question is probably more for kristen. but, you know, kristen, you mentioned some warehouse automation investments toward the end of your prepared remarks. i'm curious if you could just give a little bit more color of what exactly that entails and maybe the timing of the benefits that you expect to see out of those?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, we obviously have a lot of automation in the warehouses today. we're looking at kind of extending that further, modernizing some things generally in response to a lot of the pressure that we've seen around labor inflation recently, but certainly always just looking for opportunities to be more efficient, provide better service levels to the customer. in terms of when the benefits come online for those, ken, i'd say it's really not materially until '24.
some of those are definitely longer-term investments. but when we think about kind of like the ongoing opportunities around mission critical and what that looks like post '23, this would be kind of one of the big rock projects that start to kick up again that deliver savings in operating expenses going forward.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and i apologize if i missed it but did you specify how much those investments are?
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
i did not. no.
ken newman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for the color.
kristen actis-grande -- chief financial officer
thank you.

erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. i'll start by wishing everyone a happy new year, and i hope you had a restful and a happy holiday season. on today's call, i'm going to reflect on our first-quarter performance.
i'll offer my perspective on the current demand environment and update you on our accomplishments against our mission-critical initiatives. kristen will then provide more specifics on the quarter and our reaffirmed fiscal 2023 framework. and i'll then wrap things up, and we'll open up the line for questions. before i get into q1, i'm excited to announce that we produced our first ever esg report at the start of our fiscal year in november, actually.
you can view this report in the investor relations section of mscdirect.com. our esg journey has been one of continual improvement, and we look forward to receiving your feedback as we enhance our reporting each year. on a related front, we continue to make progress on our de&i journey by adding diversity to our senior management and our board of directors. most recently, we welcomed rahquel purcell as our newest board member, and she brings with her more than 30 years of supply chain, strategy, and digital experience, and we're very happy to have her on board.
this is the latest in what has been a series of moves to infuse new energy and new excitement and intensity into our company's leadership. turning to our performance, i'm pleased with another strong quarter that continues our string of success in the face of uncertain conditions. our primary goals for fiscal 2023 are gaining market share, expanding adjusted operating margins, and improving adjusted return on invested capital or roic. our fiscal q1 demonstrated success on all of those dimensions.
looking beyond the quarter, our five growth levers and for the productivity momentum that we're seeing have us set up to continue achieving our mission-critical targets. our manufacturing-centric end market exposure also provides us with strong resiliency in the event of economic softening. manufacturing verticals like aerospace are not yet back to pre-covid levels and therefore have plenty of room for continued growth. additionally, we stand to benefit from reshoring in the future as we are just beginning to see the positive impacts from those activities.
in addition to our focus on market share capture and productivity, we are pivoting our emphasis within category management. since covid began, our priorities were securing product availability for our customers and staying ahead of the rapid cost inflation that we all experienced. and i'm proud of our team's efforts on both fronts. our inventory position allowed us to service customers, keep plants running, and drive revenue growth.
and thanks to our strong value proposition, we were able to keep pricing ahead of purchase costs and improved gross margins during a challenging time. as the world now returns to a more normalized state of moderating inflation and stabilizing supply chains, we are initiating a fresh look at our supplier and assortment strategy. our priorities will migrate toward reducing purchase costs, streamlining operational efficiencies, improving the customer shopping experience, and channeling more market share to those suppliers who partner with us. we will accomplish these objectives through a formalized category line review process that will begin over the next couple of months led by our new coo, martina mcisaac.
we will cycle through our product lines in waves, spanning the better part of the next year. we expect most of the benefits to accrue in fiscal '24 and beyond, with some benefit hitting the latter portion of fiscal '23. i'll now turn to the specifics of the quarter. results continued to be aided by strong pricing contribution, our recent bolt-on acquisitions, and execution of our growth drivers.
we achieved average daily revenue growth of 12.9%, well above the ip index. we expanded operating margins by 140 basis points over prior year or 100 basis points on an adjusted basis, driven by the continuation of our mission-critical initiatives, which yielded additional savings of $6 million in the quarter. we remain on track to achieve our goal of at least $100 million of savings by the end of fiscal '23. our mission-critical initiatives and efforts of our entire team on cost containment and productivity has also boosted our adjusted roic into the high teens and now stands at 18.3%.
we've now already reached our original fiscal 2023 goal, and we aim to continue improving that number over time. our growth formula remains anchored in the five priorities that we've discussed as part of mission critical: solidify metalworking, expand solutions, leverage the portfolio strength, grow e-commerce and diversify customers and end markets with an emphasis on public sector. i'll now update you on each one of those. our expertise in metalworking remains the cornerstone of our value proposition, driven by the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, our large network of technical metalworking experts, and our focus on innovation as a tool to elevate productivity and lower costs for customers.
in many cases, we also help our customers to reduce waste and energy consumption. here is a recent example from the aerospace end market. one of our customers, who is a fortune 500 company, was using a four-step drilling process that took them 2.5 to three minutes to machine a certain part that goes into an airplane. after an in-depth review by our metalworking experts, we were able to take that four-step process and bring it to one step and reduced cycle time from the 2.5 to three minutes to just 10 seconds.
we also improved quality along the way. and by the customer's own calculation, they're now expecting to save over $4 million annually. our solutions growth driver is anchored by our vending and in-plant programs, both of which have been fueling market share capture over the past several quarters. vending signings remain strong with q1 signings comparable to q4.
vending machine revenues grew in the mid-teens and now represent over 15% of total company sales. in-plant signings also remained strong, with q1 again running at a similar pace to q4. in-plant customer revenues were up over 20% year over year and now represent 12% of total sales, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter. we will continue to push on this growth driver and would expect in-plant to be at 15% of total sales by the second quarter of fiscal '24.
sales to customers with our solutions offering now represent 56% of the company's total sales, up over 200 basis points from prior year. importantly, our solutions capabilities are also bringing us into diversified end markets, with recent wins coming in industries spanning from medical manufacturing, packaging and even the hospitality sector. the third priority is selling the portfolio, which is about increasing share of wallet through ancillary products, especially our ccsg business. here, we provide an outsourced vendor-managed inventory service for the high-margin c-part consumables that keep plants running.
momentum in this business continues building, with q1 ads growth in the mid-teens. our fourth priority is digital, which includes all aspects of msc's digital engagement with customers, suppliers, and associates. john hill and his team have completed a comprehensive review of our entire digital offering and have built a road map for our evolution in the space. for example, in e-commerce, recent work is focused on improving the customer experience on our website by enhancing product discovery and enriching product data.
this investment is producing early returns as e-commerce sales grew mid-teens in the first quarter. on an ads basis, we reached 61.9% as a percent of total company sales, up roughly 150 basis points compared to prior year. our fifth growth driver is customer diversification through our public sector business. over the past few quarters, i've described significant contract wins such as the 4pl contract serving the u.s.
marine's base. but we supplemented that win with others at the state and federal level. and these have helped to produce continued strong growth with q1 ads coming in over 20%, and we expect that momentum to continue throughout fiscal '23. each of our five growth levers are not only powering growth, but they're positioning msc as a productivity partner to our customers, expanding our historic role as spot-buy supplier.
in q4 of fiscal '22, we expanded our portfolio through two acquisitions in areas that we consider important to our business. in june, we acquired engman-taylor, a premier metalworking distributor in the midwest that expands our network of technical experts. we also bolstered our oem fastener distribution business through the acquisition of tower fasteners in august, which broadens our end-market exposure and increases our geographic footprint in the high-touch vmi inventory category. both businesses are running ahead of their original case in their early days.
we expect both to produce roic above our weighted average cost of capital by the end of their first full year of operations. kristen will discuss our capital allocation priorities in more detail, but we remain committed to seeking out bolt-on acquisitions that fit our strategic, financial, and cultural filters. turning to the external environment. the picture remained similar to last quarter, with sentiment readings declining and ip readings moderating.
the majority of our customers are seeing stable order levels, demand, and general activity. we are hearing, though, continued talk of softening among a portion of our customers. more recently, we experienced a higher prevalence of extended holiday shutdowns, along with weather disruptions during the second half of december. as kristen will describe, this resulted in a strong start to the month but a slow finish as activity saw a sharper decline than in the last two weeks of prior year.
zooming out though, the need for our customers to find productivity to offset their cost headwinds is as strong as it's ever been. and this plays nicely into our value proposition. so, we remain focused on delivering that productivity for our customers. i'm going to now turn things over to kristen.

thank you, erik, and good morning, everyone. on slide 5 of our presentation, you can see key metrics for the fiscal first quarter on a reported basis. slide 6 reflects the adjusted results, which will be my primary focus this morning. our first-quarter sales were up 12.9% versus the same quarter last year and came in at 957.7 million.
our first-quarter acquisitions represented roughly 3 percentage points of the growth, and fx was a 30-basis-point headwind year over year. looking at growth rate for our average daily sales by customer type, public sector sales increased over 22%, fueled by fulfillment under our 4pl contract for the u.s. marine bases and other public sector spending. national account growth was low teens, and core customers grew high single-digits.
our gross margin for the fiscal first quarter was 41.5%, down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis and up 30 basis points organically, driven by increased price more than offsetting product cost inflation. sequentially, gross margin ticked down as expected due to the ongoing realization of previously incurred product cost increases, some mix impact from our growth drivers, along with a small impact from a full quarter with tower fasteners in our numbers. looking forward, we continue to see new cost increases from our suppliers, although not at the fast-and-furious pace of last year. as a result, we anticipate taking a small pricing adjustment within the next month.
our ability to deliver continual cost savings and tangible productivity gains to our customers continues driving solid realization rates. reported operating expenses in the first quarter were 280 million versus last year's reported operating expenses of 257 million. adjusted operating expenses were also 280 million or 29.2% of net sales versus last year's adjusted operating expenses of 257 million or 30.2% of net sales. this yielded a 100-basis-point reduction in adjusted opex to sales year over year.
our reported operating margin was 12.1%, compared to 10.7% in the same period last year. adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating margin was 12.3% as compared to adjusted operating margin of 11.3% last year, a 100-basis-point improvement year over year. that resulted in an adjusted incremental margin for our first quarter of approximately 20%. reported earnings per share were $1.45 for the quarter as compared to $1.18 in the same prior-year period.
adjusted for restructuring and current year acquisition-related costs, adjusted earnings per share were $1.48 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 in the prior year period, an increase of 18%. this continues to reflect strong execution at all levels, sales performance, gross profit, and operating expenses. turning to the balance sheet. at the end of the fiscal first quarter, we were carrying 726 million of inventory, up 10 million from q4's balance.
the inventory build is consistent with our double-digit revenue growth, advantageous year-end buys, and continuing inflation. we are targeting an annual cash conversion rate of at least 100% for fiscal 2023, and we are pleased with our performance this quarter of 94% despite double-digit revenue growth and the related receivables growth. our capital expenditures were 26 million in the first quarter and included elevated vending installations, new warehouse automation, and continued investments in digital. our capital spending is front-loaded this year, and we currently expect annual capex spend in the range of 70 million to 80 million in fiscal 2023.
you can see on slide 7, our free cash flow is up year over year at 51 million for the current quarter as compared to 43 million in the prior-year quarter. note that we also spent about 19 million buying back shares during the quarter, just over 200,000 shares at an average purchase price of 79.60. we currently have 4.5 million shares remaining on our current repurchase authorization. our total debt at the end of the fiscal first quarter was 780 million, reflecting a 15 million decrease from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
as for the composition of our debt, roughly 55% was floating rate debt, and the other 45% was fixed rate debt. cash and cash equivalents were 26 million, resulting in net debt of 754 million at the end of the quarter, up slightly from 751 million at the end of the fourth quarter. our net leverage at the end of the first quarter was 1.3 times, in line with our target range of one to two times. i would also like to highlight that subsequent to closing our fiscal q1, we closed on a $300 million receivables facility, which is a committed senior secured revolving trade receivables facility that we will use to reduce our debt and overall funding rate.
it will bring our leverage ratio to just under one time. before updating you on our mission-critical productivity goals, i would like to spend a few minutes to refresh our capital allocation strategy, which you can see on slide 8. our top two priorities remain investing into the business and returning capital to shareholders through our ordinary dividend. from there, our next two priorities are tuck-in acquisitions and share buybacks at the right valuation levels.
we are deprioritizing use of special dividends as we see higher return prospects and other uses of cash. let me now update you on our mission-critical productivity goals, and i'm now on slide 9. in our fiscal first quarter, we achieved additional gross savings of 6 million and invested another 1 million. we are targeting our fiscal 2023 goal to be at least 15 million in gross savings.
warehouse automation remains an area of focus as evidenced by our recent capital investment. we're extending new automation technology throughout our fulfillment centers to strengthen our operations and mitigate the effects of labor inflation. for the total program to date, we have achieved gross savings of 91 million, and we remain on target to hit at least 100 million of gross cost savings by the end of this fiscal year. now, let's turn to the fiscal year 2023 guidance, which is shown on slide 10.
we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance as introduced during our fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call last october. we are estimating average daily sales growth of 5% to 9% and an adjusted operating margin between 12.7% and 13.3%. a few reminders as it pertains to our estimates for the year. specific to the ads growth range, fiscal 2023 has 252 days, six fewer than fiscal 2022.
the full fiscal calendar can be found on our website. our engman-taylor and tower fasteners acquisitions are included in the guidance and add roughly 200 basis points to our ads growth for the year. when we introduced guidance last quarter, forecast indicated a softening economic environment, and we factored that into our annual guidance range. as of now, we would characterize the environment and our growth trajectory as tempering a bit but still solid.
at the gross margin level, we remain on plan and expect fiscal 2023 to be down 40 to 70 basis points versus prior year, which is inclusive of the 30 to 40 basis point acquisition headwind. as we think about the cadence of our gross margins for the remainder of the year, we expect the back half of the year to be flat to slightly higher than the first half. this is due to several factors. first, the realization of product cost increases in our p&l is expected to peak over the next quarter.
second, freight costs should subside beginning in q3. third, we have several gross margin initiatives in play whose contribution builds in the back half of the year. erik mentioned one, which is a new category line review process, but there are others with a near-term time horizon. on the operating expense line, we expect a slight increase in operating expense as a percentage of sales in q2, consistent with our typical seasonal pattern, with sequential declines thereafter.
our mission-critical productivity efforts will allow us to continue investing in our growth strategy despite ongoing inflation headwinds. factoring in those assumptions, we expect adjusted operating margin to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.3%. excluding the 20 basis points benefit of the extra week from fiscal 2022, this would reflect operating margin expansion at nearly all points within our range. as a reminder, our fiscal 2022 fourth-quarter acquisitions dilute operating margins by approximately 20 basis points in fiscal '23, their first full year with us.
while dilutive to operating margins in the first year, both acquisitions are accretive to eps and on track to achieve an roic above weighted average cost of capital in their first full year of operations. holding fiscal '23 debt constant with current levels, we would expect roughly 8 million to 10 million of interest and other expense per quarter and tax rates slightly under 25%. given our expectations for an operating cash flow conversion of roughly 100%, we will have flexibility to deploy free cash flow into debt reduction, buybacks, or accretive acquisitions. during our last call, we introduced our downturn playbook that we have at the ready should we experience a significant demand slowdown.
we have clearly defined triggers for changes in our actual or forecasted revenue and operating profit that initiate a series of actions we'll take across the business. this includes everything from pullbacks on discretionary spending, changes in staffing levels, and reprioritization of investments. in addition, our balance sheet remains strong. and when the economy slows, we generate high levels of cash flow as working capital becomes a source of funding.
this will enable us to pay down debt and/or strategically invest through the downturn. we are not in that mode as of now, and we remain well positioned to navigate a change in the environment, if required, by enacting these levers to control costs. i will now turn it back over to erik.
erik gershwind -- chief executive officer
thanks, kristen. we are pleased with our first-quarter performance, which is on the heels of a strong fiscal '22 in what remains a complex operating environment. we remain on track to achieve each of our mission-critical goals for the end of fiscal '23, and we are seeing momentum build quarter over quarter inside of the company. this is an exciting time for msc as we position the company as a partner of choice among our customers.
we see a bright future ahead, and we'll continue to reinvest into the business. regardless of the macro environment, we remain squarely focused on what we can control: capturing market share, growing above ip, and translating that growth into profit expansion. i'd like to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication, and we'll now open up the line for questions.
